It's crazy to realize how much all the attention on the 'war on drugs' has died down. Seeing this video was reminiscent to how drug cartels would summarily execute people off the streets. If people are dying left and right, and the notion of labeling their deaths as 'police self defence,' or that the victims fought back, and leaving it at that, then no one is safe to this kind of cruelty.
 Tomorrow, the very people being left to die on the streets just might be me and you. Unless of course you're of a rich and/or influential family. Move along, I guess this shouldn't concern you.","December 9, 2018 2:16:15 AM +08"
"18290","I saw this girl last thursday. She was hanging out with a bunch of Icans and while I was going down the stairs, I tripped. All of them laughed except for one, she helped me and even asked if I was okay. I was so flustered and just stared at her face. She had the most amazing smile and I couldn't even utter a word. It was funny because she actually got mad at her friends for laughing at me. And as she was helping me pick up my things, she giggled, not bec
ause of me but because she also fell in those damn stairs in the library and she felt like shit when people just stared at her so she didn't want the same thing to happen to me. She had such a distinctive laugh, the best one I have ever heard so far.  She had to leave before I could even thank her and ask for her name. All I know is that she was wearing the film org lanyard. She might be an Ican because I knew some of the people she was with were from that school.  I really want to see this girl again. I have yet to thank her and I really am looking forward to personally meet someone with her kindness. If any of you know her, please tag her. Because I think I just met my soul mate.","December 9, 2018 2:15:33 AM +08"

And the classic places like Gong Cha and Serenitea had as many employees as usual Coco branches have today, so I don't get what the problem is.

And I don't even know why Coco takes forever to serve customers. If they know they have a queuing problem, why the hell aren't they opening more lines? Why 
don't their new branches have more lines? I get that Coco might think that people will end up ordering anyway because Coco, but this is not sustainable at all. So many of us have stopped buying from Coco already because of the ridiculous waiting times, and we're surely not the last ones to renounce it. At the end of the day, all this waiting is just not worth it. We spend 45 minutes to an hour in line just for a drink that's more milk than it is tea. For shame, Coco.

The school's academics is not challenging - it is tedious.
 The school is not exclusive - it is insular. I personally value the importance of preserving Jesuit ideals. However, the school needs to discern the difference between preserving tradition and staying behind. Why would international students flock to Ateneo? Its new and exclusive foreigner dorm? Why? Isn't its ranking slipping behind its international counterparts? What is the point of pouring cash into winning basketball when its very arch nemesis, UP and DLSU have been winning the game of THE university world rankings? Maybe we should just turn into a basketball institution. This is its core competency after all. Its leaders need to learn how to guide the institution through the novel complexities - oddities - of the strange new world. This is a quote from a prominent Benildean in regards to their school's identity - and yes, it is that school which Ateneans somehow /still/ look down upon. ""...our job is to write what is yet to be written"" This is how you move forward. To ride the waves, the excitement of the new times rather than to bury one's head under the sand. This is what it means to be a truly educational institution. Lux in Domino? Light in the Lord?  How is pushing students to darkness with stress that leads to abnormal levels of anxiety, depression and excessive alcohol use among many more, supposed to lead them to light? You are saying we need to learn to be followers before we can be leaders?  To be servants? Isn't our rigid, rote model for learning turning us into brain-dead subservient drones instead? Where is Cura Personalis?  Where is Care for the Entire Person? I just fucking hate seeing my friends so fucking down and miserable all the time. I hate seeing them tired, with a frown drawn on their faces when I meet them. They are capable of so much more. They deserve to live. To grow.  Even many teachers! There is nothing more sad than seeing a professor lose their spark for teaching. Hasn't everything turned into Care for the Ego?  I will pray and hope this institution is turned around and into the light by Ateneo's very own leaders. As soon as possible. The world is changing too quickly.

Kaya the next OR LTs were made so much harder. I don't know if they did the same sa other subj

I hope the ME Program will investigate this case kasi grabe sinisira nila ang pangalan ng ME. Please be ashamed of yourselves. Karma is a bitch.

"18156","You know I'm honestly so frustrated about Grab Coco. I miss Regis Coco before it was just overflowing with Grab Drivers. Of course nothing is going to change because people can have Coco wherever they are, and Coco is earning so much more because the number of customers has skyrocketed. But I've been going to Regis Coco because I love the place and I love hanging out with friends over there. It was a nice place to relax and have a good time. The ambiance
 was lively but not exhausting. It was homely but not boring. I have had wonderful memories in every seat, and have had laughs with some of the employees even.  But the Grab drivers just ruin it. The line is so long, I could stand in line for 30 minutes. Even when I do get to order, I could wait an hour in my seat before I get my drink. Why? Because there are 10 Grab drivers, each ordering multiple drinks. Coco wasn't always like this. Of course there was usually a line, and of course there was always a wait time. But in the past few months, the lines have gotten unbearably long, and the waiting time has become ridiculous.  Customers who still go there in-person suffer. There are chairs and table there because it's also a sit-down place; part of Coco is the store, not just the drink. It's not just a hole in the wall that pumps out drinks to people.  I'm letting out my frustrations, but I know nothing's gonna change. In fact, it could get even worse. Coco's earning, Grab drivers will have a consistent source of income, and people are comfortable having the Coco come to them. But for someone who has loved Coco for years, with part of that experience coming from sitting in the store and enjoying a few hours IN the physical store of Coco, I miss those days.

Ok so how does it fucking help if God loves me? The suffering is still there, and whatever issue there is remains. When people ask for divine intervention, doesn't that go against the
 nature of God? If God were to impose his will on others, that would be a violation. *God pls give us this win* *God pls grant me this *insert shit that is affected by anything else except 'god'*  It feels that we just use God as a way to cope with reality, but I think it would be better if we come to terms with reality rather than trying to have God accountable or a factor for whatever shit that comes our way instead of deluding ourselves.","December 6, 2018 9:24:52 PM +08"

"18146","I miss those days when we shared coffee in the morning, near the computer terminals before class starts. It didn't matter whether it was the good stuff or the cheap stuff, we would share and drink it anyway. It made the mornings bright seeing you at the corner of my vision while we worked on our own separate things in our separate terminals. I had someone nice to occasionally talk to about work, music, movies, and coffee. We knew each other for some time
 already but it was during this time that I fell in love with you. I think it was because you were really nice to me more than anything. You were the only person I felt at ease with. I thought... maybe I should give love a try. I've been putting it off for nearly four years of college because of loose ends I never managed to tie up. And with the things I was going through at the time, I thought that what happened to my good old friend was good lesson on acting when the moment was still there. Life's short and I might not have another chance at this. I thought that with all that was going on, I might as well release the floodgates of all these ambiguous emotions in one go than to do it in installments. Now, there are times when I wish I had never confessed. Now things are difficult. There are moments by happenstance that you'd be walking in front of me and I just freeze up. I'd walk the opposite direction and find another route. In  moments that we pass by each other, I tense up, trying my best to control my nerves and the shaking in my hands. I try my best to be as small and inconspicuous as possible just so I don't get seen. I'd tip my hat, look at my phone, read something - anything to cover my face. I was just really scared. All my usual confidence and bravado just drain away in those moments. I don't even have the confidence to talk to you casually in chat. Just thinking about talking to you makes me nervous and unsure what to say. Sorry that things became like this. At the very least, I can move on without regrets. I said that it was better to try failing than not try at all. But hey, that's what all of losers say in the end.","December 6, 2018 6:32:07 PM +08"

Defending it just makes it worse for you because you show even more support to the petty bringing up of World Rankings.  So now I ask this question to these UP peeps.

Why not offer a revamped course as a free elective that covers the key topics of Ph

I've been with this guy for almost half a year na. Our last SOs cheated on us. We originally agreed to have a non-serious relationship, and we thought that this was just a short term fling. But now, it's past 5 months na and we're almost living together. We haven't said ILYs yet but there were some instances na parang kaunting push na lang fro
m me/him DTR na, then we keep on reminding each other not to fall in love. We seem to be giving mixed signals to each other and I personally am doubtful as to how I feel about him. I feel like we're both holding back because of our pasts. So maybe if I am assured that he's not gonna cheat on me (and I can assure him that I won't cheat on him) like we've experience before, then maybe he's the one? I'm not scared of him leaving me, I think I'm a strong, independent woman naman who can handle her own life. But I don't want him to leave yet. Kaso I'm not sure about my feelings either.

I fucking hate the working world. lol
 I miss being a student. I miss our beautiful campus. I miss hanging out in one of the Sec Walk benches at night and just taking in the fresh air and quiet. I miss my orgs, and being a part of projects I actually want to be a part of. I miss having complete control of my time. I miss studying for finals and getting nervous during oral exams. I miss walking past Zen Garden to my next class. I miss my friends. I miss actually feeling care-free. I miss cutting class to drink with friends anywhere along Katip. I miss Gonzaga and JSEC. I miss the profs I ended up becoming friends with. I miss attending classes, in general. I miss corny class activites that end up being fun. I miss when I actually had time for my friends and family. I MISS BEING GENUINELY HAPPY AND CONTENT IN ALL ASPECTS OF MY LIFE. I thought going down from the hill would be exciting and a step toward life’s new adventure for me... but all I feel right now is sad and stuck. Other aspects of my life aren’t so happy anymore.. and I feel like i’m just trying to get through the day..  I miss you, Ateneo... I miss you so fucking much.

All this passive-aggressiveness towards UP and Adamson doesn't make you look credible or level-headed, it just makes you look petty and condescending. It'd be understandable if it was trash talk, but this is something beyond that. This is masturbation. Sometimes I wonder if your ass gets jealous of all the shit that comes out of your mouth. Instead of writing petty
 tweets to try and save face or shift the blame elsewhere, you should have some accountability and correct your mistakes. Deleting a tweet isn't enough. Get your head out of your ass. If you're going to behave like this, then don't put Ateneo's name on your handle because the rest of us don't want to be associated with garbage like this. I won't deny that it's a good thing we won, but for fuck's sake, that win is worthless if this is how you're going to act about it. You have to be better than that. Believe it or not, class is something that can be taught but only if you're willing to learn. That smug, self-congratulatory attitude needs to go. It's not doing anyone any favors and all it does is frustrate people, both inside and outside of ADMU. On another note, this is really fucking straightforward and I'm sure you're aware, but if you're going to quote an article, use quotation marks. That way, people will know you didn't say it yourself and there'll be no harm done. If you don't make it clear that you're quoting someone, then it just looks like you're parroting what they've said and passing it off as your own.

There was one who posted a picture of his meal in MiniStop. I scrolled down a bit more and had a sudden realization. That post saying “Kain tayo” is one of the most heartbreaking. “Kain tay
o” means that for that person, Francis is still alive. Moreover, inviting someone to dine with means that Francis was an important part of his life. He may have been that person’s best friend.

Everyone loves a good underdog story and it’s amazing seeing UP do so well when in the past they were known for consistently ending up last place in the UAAP but I keep seeing UP fans (ESPECIALLY ON TWITTER HOLY SHIT) acting as if they deserve the championship just cause they are the underdogs in this story.

Fact is Ateneo has dominated the league the whole year and UP hasn’t
 been able to put up a fight against the Eagles in pior meetings.  Congrats to UP for the amazing year, y’all were phenomenal and the community’s support has been unheard of but at the same time don’t get butthurt when the expected happens.","December 3, 2018 11:52:19 PM +08"

Tweeting/posting/sharing about wanting to die or ""kill me"" as an expression just because you're stressed or inconvenienced really downplays the meaning of saying things like that. Personally it also makes me concerned and confused because I really don't know if you're clinically depressed or really need help if you're just sayin
g it for the hell of it.  I understand why people who are actually suicidal would say something like that, and really it's a call for help and concern because here you have a person who's actually thinking of killing themselves but then all you say is ""same"" (yes I'm referring to that one FW post I can't find anymore). You're desensitizing the general public to the notion of death that when people actually say it and actually MEAN it... it just gets lost in indifference. You’ve failed to notice a red flag. Worse yet, you know DAMN well it was a red flag but conditioned yourself to believe it wasn’t because you hear it all the damn time as a JOKE. What then? I’m seriously worried and confused if people are just joking or not, and death IS NOT a joke. Please think a little bit more about those who are actually suicidal and need help when you're thinking of mentioning something about dying when you don't even mean it. That's all. I may have offended some, and I'm sorry, but all I wanted to say was, don't treat death and suicide as a joke. And for those who are actually and genuinely crying out for help, please seek help from a solid support system like friends and family but more importantly, professional help. The world will NOT be better off without you, please please please remember that.","December 3, 2018 5:16:46 PM +08"

I saw a post here before where the person was asking if people are willing to date someone who voted for Duterte and continues to support him. 
 I mean first of all, Davao is one of the safest cities in the Philippines all thanks to Duterte. He secretly watches the locals to ensure their safety. Second, is the political point of view the only that thing that matters to you when finding your jowa? Third, Duterte is not a dictator... yet. I know he hasn’t declared Martial Law so why are many people specially the universities I mentioned saying that he’s a dictator. Fourth, he has done a lot of things for our country. If I were to mention all of it, I could be writing a thesis by now. Fifth, just because his works are done silently doesn’t mean that he’s not doing anything at all. The things he does for our country is not being broadcast by the news because they’re bias towards him. Sixth, people are so quick to judge. Just because of what they see on social media. Just because of the awful words coming out of his mouth doesn’t mean that he is the worst president.  I know that everybody is entitled to their own opinion but I don’t understand why most UP student initiate rallies to fight against Duterte when in fact, the government and our president is the reason why most of you, UP Students don’t have to pay for your tuition fee.

POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says ""I want to be the richest man alive."" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 300 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says ""I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life."" POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. The first guy says: ""I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth."" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. The second guy says ""I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want."" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. The third guy says ""I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die."" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. The first guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him anymore. The second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever."" POOF, he looks younger already. The third guy smiles triumphantly and says ""My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth."" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. The first guy is ecstatic: ""I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years."" The second guy smiles and says ""Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.""

Naiinis kayo na may tumatawag ng foul sa nagawa ni Kouame kay Akhuetie? i wonder if that same perception applied when Mbala accidentally elbowed Nieto? Don't pretend that just because you guys are more used to being in the finals, that means you're more knowledgeable about basketball than us. Laos na yung ""ngayon lang nasa finals kaya ngayon lang nanonood"" arguement. To watch a basketball game only when you're team is playing might be true for some Ateneans, but plenty of UP students watch basketball games outside the UAAP and even games in the UAAP where UP isn't playing. And I will fully acknowledge that the same criticism applies to UP as well, but to claim that only Ateneo has the final say on contentious matters in the game is just plain arrogant. At ang kakapal ng mga mukha niyo na sabihing mas mayabang ang mga taga-UP. Look in the mirror motherfuckers.","December 2, 2018 8:18:02 PM +08"

 U.P fans were overheard being racist. They were literally overheard saying ""tanginang negro nito."" A few U.P students even assaulted a few ADMU fans.  Is it really wrong to say that calling Kouame a ""negro"" is classless? Is it really wrong to say that assaulting people is classless? Getting into arguments with people minding their own business?  Elitism is wrong, and generalizing U.P students is wrong as obviously those instances above weren't the majority, likewise the multiple corrupt politicians supporting U.P aren't even liked by the U.P community. It's wrong to generalize I agree with you. But don't use the ""social construct"" excuse to justify yourself defending multiple people who shouted ""negro"" in this day and age.

This is unsolicited advice to seek legal advice to rape victims like in #ADMUFreedomWall17145
 The guidance, sanggu or ADSA may or may not represent your interests, but your lawyer would. The guidance, sanggu or ADSA might (we won't really know for sure until AFTER THE FACT) be more interested in bringing the rapist to justice than giving you justice. You might think these two concepts ""bringing the perpetrator to justice"" and ""giving the victim justice"" are identical. If they are, then you can ignore this post. See 13 Reasons Why or any legal drama where rape victims are cross-examined furiously by defense attorneys. (For non-fictional examples, I wouldn't know of any that are relevant or relatable to non-lawyers. Let's hope 13 Reasons Why or those legal dramas are as realistic as they need to be here for this purpose) Prosecuting rapists is hard because our society values of privacy over security and allows defense attorneys to embarrass rape victims in court. Is Kevin Spacey or Charlie Rose in jail? Oh, did you forget that you might have to testify especially that you might not have a rape kit?  This is not meant to show you there is no hope. This is meant to show you there might be some dangers without first seeking legal advice. Let me emphasize that this is not legal advice. This might not even be (good) advice on seeking legal advice.

As for the toxicity, I must admit that there are both good and bad guys from both UP and Ateneo. Let’s not generalize! I vaguely remember my ex-iska girlfriend cheering for Ateneo during UAAP basketball, and myself 
cheering for UP during cheerdance competitions. Now we are closely matched (both kulelat in cheerdance, and now finalists in basketball). At the end of the day, it’s just a game, and if you take it upon yourself to generalize a whole community, then that’s on you. I, too, would be upset if our MVP was injured. Intentionally or unintentionally, a foul is a foul. UP also recognized that the officiating was unfair even on Ateneo’s side. What I got from them is, even though they lost, they were upset at the refs, NOT at their loss. This has been happening since their games with Adamson. This goes to both schools: I hope, by game 2, win or lose, it’s a fair game and we all hug it out after.

"17777","This is basically the equivalent of people attacking GMO's because they're scientifically illiterate. But in sports.

Look, here's the thing: this isn't an anime. Kouame didn't just ""foul on purpose so the best player in U.P gets injured.""
 It doesn't work that way, seriously it's a joke to even think that's how it worked. For power forwards/big men in the NBA, what Kouame did is incredibly common. It's not even uncommon, just watch a few NBA games and you'll see it. The actually uncommon thing though is that it caught the other player by surprise, he ended up with wrong footing and got injured.  The difference between a huge false controversy and a non backlash game is wrong footing.  No one in Ateneo is celebrating, nor should we be, it's an unfortunate injury. But this isn't some fantasy land where the ""hero underdog"" you're rooting for gets injured so the stacked team wins. It's just how the UAAP works, it's just how the NBA works, it's how basketball works. It's a sad thing that happened, but it's objectively wrong to say that it was done on purpose, just watch other basketball games for once.  Obviously this isn't just a UP thing. Ateneo, DLSU, UST, NU and a lot of other fans are guilty of this too. Understanding game mechanics and watching a few basketball games can help you realize that a lot of the things you thought were wrong is basically just normal. Besides, understanding basketball before watching a UAAP game let's you appreciate the game alot more, and the skills of these players...aside from stopping you from making ignorant tweets about a sport you have absolutely no knowledge of.","December 1, 2018 8:03:06 PM +08"
"17768","The Toyota Supra is a car that is revered by many. Often pitted against the Nissan Skyline GT-R, the Supra is easily one of the finest Japanese sports cars to have ever emerged from the country. There are many trims that the MK-4 Supra was offered in, but this particular example is a rather unheard of RZ-S. Here are the cool things that came with the RZ-S trim.

The Supra RZ-S is a mid-spec trim of the twin-turbo MK4 Supra that falls between the GZ and th
e RZ. Thus, it isn't as fully decked out as the RZ, but it has more 'sporty' features that differentiate it from the base-model GZ. The RZ-S came with a 4-speed automatic with 'manual shifting mode' as standard, however buyers had the option of dumping a little more dough to get the car with a Getrag 6-speed manual and a Torsen LSD thrown into it, just like what the owner of this RZ-S did. The RZ-S came with 16 inch wheels just like the one in the picture, however customers were given the option of paying more to swap it for 17 inch wheels with bigger brakes coming along with the package. The famous rear wing of the Supra was also a dealer option on the RZ-S, as only the RZ came with it as standard. In terms of interior differences, both the RZ and the RZ-S had similar interiors, all except for the front and rear seats: the RZ-S wasn't offered with Recaro seats just like the RZ was. Aside from all those changes I've mentioned though, the RZ-S possessed little differences from the RZ, although with all of the dealer options that the RZ-S had, I'd rather just pay more to get an RZ that comes with all those features I've mentioned and more as standard. Nevertheless, the RZ-S was the cheapest Supra trim that came with the famed twin-turbo 2JZ and 6-speed tranny, and so the RZ-S was also famous with tuners!!!","December 1, 2018 6:52:45 PM +08"

"17747","People are attacking the black shirt wearing thing that both Ateneo and UP student councils agree on. Mainly due to how apparently they're useless and are pretty vague. Also because of ""hypocrisy"" due to harrasment cases and mysogyny cases in both Ateneo and UP.

I don't think the first two statements even have to be explained to why they're wrong but I'll do it. Here's the thing, protests don't necessarily have to have a solid physical impact. Awareness
 has always been the focus. For example both the numerous UP protests and the black shirt Lasalle game both got people talking, they both got coverage and did remind people of problems present in society. In regard to vagueness, in a country where the president threatens our sovereignty due to pandering to China, supports sexism, supports corrupt politicians, and does many other things, it's hard to focus on just a single issue when the entirety of what he does is absolutely trash. There's just too much important blunders happening to just focus on one. Lastly in regard to hypocrisy, it's like attacking Americans for critiquing Russia for annexing parts of Ukraine. Sure they're going to say ""ohh but America also meddles in other countries."" Okay, then what is your point? You literally just stated a fact that is irrelevant to whether the target being critiqued is wrong or not.  I mean what's so bad about encouraging people to wear black? They could've done nothing, they wouldn't even get backlash, but in the end, it's not some evil thing to encourage people to wards political solidarity against the dozens of problems present in our country, a set of problems so wide that it can only be tackled in totality through a vague issue such as ""violence.""","December 1, 2018 3:22:14 PM +08"

""This is a story about a lonely, lonely man. He lived in a lonely house. On a lonely street. In a lonely part of the world. But, of course, he had the internet. The internet, as you know, was his friend — you could say, his best friend. They would play with each other every day, watching videos of humans doing all sorts of things: Having sex with each other; Informing people on what
 was wrong with them and their life; Playing games with young children at home with their parents One day, the man — whose name was @SnowflakeSmasher86 — turned to his friend, the internet, and he said, “Internet, do you love me?” The internet looked at him and said, “Yes. I love you very, very, very, very, very, very much. I am your best friend. In fact, I love you so much that I never, ever want us to be apart ever again ever’
 ‘I would like that,” said the man. And so they embarked on a life together. Wherever the man went, he took his friend. The man and the internet went everywhere together, except of course the places where the internet could not go. They went to the countryside. They went to birthday parties of the children of some of his less important friends. Different countries. Even the moon. When the man got sad, his friend had so many clever ways to make him feel better. He would get him cooked animals and show him the people having sex again, and he would always, always agree with him. This one was the man’s favorite, and it made him very happy. The man trusted his friend so much. “I feel like I could tell you anything,” he said, on a particularly lonely day “You can. You can tell me anything. I’m your best friend. Anything you say to me will stay strictly between you and the internet.” And so he did. The man shared everything with his friend: All of his fears and desires; All of his loves, past and present; All of the places he had been and was going, and pictures of his penis. He would tell himself, “Man does not live by bread alone.” And then he died

  So now, you’re confused. You’re not so sure if you really like her. But the thing is, you jumped into the relationship too quickly to the point that you can’t really claim that you  know her.  So before you think about leaving her, make certain of your feelings by actually taking the effort to see the real her. Please take it slow.

As a tribute to the rich history of the Skyline GT-R (which ended in 2002), NISMO purchased 18 used R34 GT-R V-specs, all of which were to be reworked by the company into one of its most impressive creations to date.

NISMO extensively rebuilt the car's stock RB26 engine, by replacing virtually all of the engine's original components with variants used by NISMO for
 their race cars. Special race-car engine treatment like balancing and boring and stroking were done to the RB, increasing its displacement to 2.8L. Even the turbos weren't spared, as the ones used by the normal V-spec were replaced with IHI turbos that were set to 1.5 boost. With the engine being complimented by the replaced intercooler and exhaust system, the Z-tune' is capable of producing 510hp!  The rest of the car was also given a meticulous makeover by NISMO. The car's ability to handle the horses without slip was improved by the utilization of both a twin-plate clutch and an LSD. Parts that were located towards the front of the car such as the front bumper, strut bar, and hood were replaced with carbon fiber variants so as to reduce the weight of the front half of the car. A lot of these CF parts were even spot welded by NISMO to improve the rigidity of the chassis! To lessen body-roll and improve handling, NISMO also replaced the stock V-spec springs with stiffer adjustable ones and adjusted them, giving the car a stiffer suspension, not too good for the streets, but perfect for the track. Special Brembo brakes ensured that the Z-tune had better braking performance, while downforce was improved by the addition of a front splitter and a change of rear spoiler, increasing both front and rear downforce respectively. All of these improvements are not all for show though: The Z-tune was able to set an insane Tsukuba lap time of 1:01, making it the 4th fastest road-legal production car on the track!  Nissan originally planned to create 19 examples of this beast, but they ended up producing only 18 Ztunes. This low number of production,combined with this car being a good showcase of NISMO's tuning capabilities, drives the prices of the R34 Z-tune extremely high. From its original selling price of only 17 million yen when new (around $100k), the current selling price of these cars are now in excess of $500k (this particular example selling for $510k!) Sadly, this very high value makes it a collector's item today, which is why you're more likely to find the car now in some rich guy's climate-controlled garage instead of the tracks where this beast truly belongs.","November 26, 2018 8:48:47 PM +08"

Special Brembo brakes ensured that the Z-tune had better braking performance, while downforce was improved by the addition of a front splitter and a change of rear spoiler, increasing both front and rear downforce respectively. All of these improvements are not all for show though: The Z-tune was able to set an insane Tsukuba lap time of 1:01, making it the 4th fastest road-legal production car on the track!  Nissan originally planned to create 19 examples of this beast, but they ended up producing only 18 Ztunes. This low number of production,combined with this car being a good showcase of NISMO's tuning capabilities, drives the prices of the R34 Z-tune extremely high. From its original selling price of only 17 million yen when new (around $100k), the current selling price of these cars are now in excess of $500k (this particular example selling for $510k!) Sadly, this very high value makes it a collector's item today, which is why you're more likely to find the car now in some rich guy's climate-controlled garage instead of the tracks where this beast truly belongs.","November 26, 2018 8:47:14 PM +08"

"17332","Hi, I matched with this guy from tinder named Cj 5 months ago. He has an anonymous profile but says he's from ADMU and judging by the way he talks, I'd say theres a pretty huge chance he is. Anyway, we started talking and from the very start I knew he's in it for the sex but since I was hella bored I started entertaing him. Well, he made me laugh really hard and he would put in a dirty joke or two in the proper context then it would get me going. He was 
really respectful naman and he has a thing with always mentioning consent idk lol but it was cute. It went on for a week, i started talking about myself more openly since I felt at ease. He made me feel safe talking to him. I started talking about my issues and my depression. I have friends but something about the fact that he was basically anonymous made me feel i can tell me anything. He helped me get through a lot and you can say he's my happy place. I genuinely felt better amd started being happy. But then his midterms came and wesuddenly slowly stopped talking, I understood naman and didnt want to bother him. Maybe after two weeks not talking I decided to hit him up. But he didnt reply. We were using telegram and it said last seen was 2 weeks ago rin. Then it must mean he changed numbers or deleted tg. I looked through tinder but I couldnt find his profile anymore. Please help me find him :( I remember his profile saying he's 6'3, does jiujitsu and ballroom in admu. I just wanna know if found another girl that would lead him to deleting his tinder or he just doesnt wanna talk to me anymore. I miss talking to him. Please help me find him guys, I haven't even had the chance to see him yet. It's just been eating me up. Cj talk to me again plis :'(

Super Eurobeat Presents: Volume 1
Fun Fact: Aleph is just one of the stage names of well known Eurobeat 

 singer and producer Dave Rodgers! This song is one of his earlier ones, 
 as it came out in 1989.  (I) don't like to be your friend cause
 I can do much better
 Can give you many more things To prove you I'm your man Why should I give in and be a loser
 Can't you see all I want Is your love
 So I'm gonna change
 And make another start I'd like to be your hero
 Tell me my feeling's right
 And I guess you won't mind
 Sometimes zero
 Spending the rest of my life
 Like your hero not only your lover (I) don't want to be a toy
 You're using just to play with
 A toy you drop or break
 To prove youself you're strong Why should I put up with my big lot
 Can't you see that all I want Is your love
 So I'm gonna chance
 And make another start I'd like to be your hero
 Tell me my feeling's right
 And I guess you won't mind
 Sometimes zero
 Spending the rest of my life
 Like your hero not only your lover Hero
 Tell me my feeling's right
 And I guess you won't mind
 Sometimes zero
 Spending the rest of my life
 Like your hero not only your lover (I) don't like to be your friend cause
 I can do much better (I) don't want to be a toy

"17058","This is the only place I can post this kasi I'm a bit of a closet kpop fan. Anyways, I really like Twice's song Yes or Yes.

PERO!!!
 Naiinis ako sa chord progression ng verse. This is the original (taken from ultimate-guitar) E               Emaj7
 Naega ireokedo igijeogieotdeonga
 E7                  E6                 A
 Mwonga ireoke gatgo sipdeon jeok isseonna, isseonna
        Dsus2                 E
 Da nolla, da nolla, nae ppeonppeonhame
 E C          D
 (Come on and tell me yes) Now in general ok naman siya. I really love the 'step-down' chord progression na medyo nagiging uso narin now (which iirc is actually a pretty old chord progression, like 70's or 80's nandun na siya, medyo 2000's lang sumikat ung I-IV-V chord progression). What really annoys me, is the Dsus2 part. Like, you're already going down the note na. From E-> Emaj7 -> E7 -> E6 -> A. Tapos babalik ka agad pataas with a Dsus2 e hindi ka pa nga nakakarating sa pupuntahan mo??? >_> Leave it at the end going back to E para mas fulfilling and sulit ung trip down. Guys try niyo. Instead of Dsus2, try a simple Am chord after A.  It sounds at least 67.3% better than using Dsus2, without necessarily making the song a bit darker.  If any Twice fans here can play the guitar or piano, let me know what you think hehe  E               Emaj7

He markets it as a ""youth development"" program in barangays. Supposedly, he incubates projects in the barangay that can improve it. The catch? He asks for an insane amount of money (hundreds of thousands) from the LGU to run his ""program"" but how many of those projects actually come to life? Hmm... And where does all that money go? Hmm...
 He also sends people to the ""UN"" and asks for a crazy amount of money too. I heard the participants of his ""training program"" for this ""UN thing"" always have a ton of complaints because it's not run well.  Is this what Ateneo taught us? Is this ""development"" or is Scammy S just using people and barangays for money? Oh and Scammy S also likes to take credit for his team's work without doing any of the actual work. He just likes the photo ops in high level places so he looks cool. I think three full core teams have quit under him because of his lack of professionalism. Come on, Scammy S!

I'm glad that the typical anakbayan types of groups are focusing more on this nowadays rather than U.S intervention thousands of kilometers away. Don't get me wrong, it's important too as things like Iraq were wrong, but I'm pretty sure a country which aims to say that an entire SEA is their exclusive property, including areas only 50 miles 
away from Palawan, is more important.  Sure, these types of people post US-China-Duterte triumvirate regime posters/graffiti thinking that Xi Jinping is secretly teamed up with Trump or some other flat Earth tier belief but atleast they're finally focusing more on this joke of a map.  Seriously, everyone should. Like this is straight up imperialism, and it's not happening in some other continent, it's happening a few dozen miles away from Palawan. This is not okay. P.S: 1 million Uyghur muslim natives are being put in ""re-education"" camps by the Chinese government right now, with some being tortured...and we're getting closer politically and now physically to this country.

They mention how we should just focus on sports like billiards and football or some other height appropriate game. They say that basketball programs should be defunded and that we should literally just play for the medals.

Here's the reality. You aren't going to convince any young basketball player to play football by defunding basketball programs. These people pl
ay basketball because it's an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because it's what they want, it's what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids aren't playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country won't produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldn't even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but I'd rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they don't give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball won't turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you can't convince a person who loves Kyrie Irving's insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal. A gold medal which he doesn't give a shit about, a medal only there so that Filipinos can brag about being Filipinos.","November 19, 2018 11:53:02 PM +08"

"16619","This is my opinion but I think that an underlying problem with ADMU is that it discourages its students from walking around, given how certain important buildings like Bellarmine Hall and ISO are located FAR AWAY from where most of the Loyola School (LS) buildings are clustered. Meanwhile the really niche buildings like PIPAC, the freshman dorm halls (Cervini/Eliazo), and even the ASOG are located closer to LS. It's why students complain a lot about thei
r BEL-CTC scheds and you can't blame them since they were probably batch 2 and were forced to pick those BEL classes next to their CTC classes. In any case, it still doesn't take away my point that the way ADMU has been planned has been quite crap. Instead of devoting so much money on creating more and maintaining existing parking spaces and encouraging students to bring their cars, they should've just focus on relocating the important buildings like cafeterias and BEL/FA ANNEX buildings closer to the LS area. This would've perhaps lead students to rely less on their cars, which will eventually reduce the need for parking spaces, and use those other remaining spaces as ports for trikes and other public transpo. That way, that remaining space will take up even less space compared to the already existing parking spaces. Even so, it would also help create more space for more trees = more shade = relatively cooler campus. At the very least I do hope they could at least make their existing buildings more ""green"" (though I'm not saying that in a Lasallian way). I mean, allowing vertical gardens to be a thing in the existing building clusters like Leong Hall, Rizal Libs, Soc Sci, De La Costa, etc.  Regardless, what Ateneo should be doing is making its campus even more pedestrian friendly, since in all honesty, it's one of the best campuses to stroll around.  Thus, making it more ""walkable"" will perhaps help ease out the traffic outside Katipunan. #UrbanPlanningADMU","November 18, 2018 5:42:52 PM +08"

[Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino.

A few days ago, I was walking home from another late-night orientation. I was taking my usual route out of Ateneo — I'd exit from CTC then make my way through SOM forest until I arrived at the covered path to Gate 2.5. But once I reached the forest, I knew there was something wrong. The hair on my arms stood up as I surveyed the unnaturally dark surrounding. I noticed that it was too quiet, as if the whole forest was holdi
ng its breath. Despite this, I braved on, determined to get home. And anyways, it was just a short path. What was the worst that could happen, right? As I walked, the post about the Rendezvous Girl popped in my head. I shrugged the thoughts away — it was just another silly story for scaring people. Also, I'm a girl. I was sure that the offer of ""free head"" wouldn't apply to me.  In the distance, I could already see the lights from the covered pathway. With newfound courage (and a bit of smugness), I jokingly whispered ""Rendezvous"". As the word escaped my lips, a chill emitted from behind me. Every cell in my body was shouting for me to run, but I turned around anyway.  That's when I saw him. The first thing I noticed was the paper bag on his head. Up to now, the crudely drawn smiley is still branded in my memory. My eyes went down, trailing over his naked and grimy body, until they settled over a smaller paper bag, with a similar smiley, covering his nether region. In another situation, I would have found it funny, but at that moment, all I felt was fear.  He tilted his head to the side and curled his index finger two times, a summon for me to draw nearer. I can't explain it, but I took a step toward him. I was only 5 feet away when the lower paper bag fell off. A scream formed in the back of my throat as I saw the mangled and rotting remains of his phallus. A thick fetid gooey liquid was spurting out, and maggots were crawling through holes in the skin. I finally ran, the fastest that I've ever ran in my life, all the way to Gate 2.5, then all the way home.  But what happened in SOM forest stayed with me. Every night, I dream of Rendezvous Guy. Every night, he beckons me to come back. And every night, I feel myself slowly giving in.","September 30, 2018 12:52:20 PM +08"

Borderline suicidal already and stuff but what really encouraged me and made me smile despite the pain was when I got on the phone with my sister in the CR in SEC B then I guess the Ate overheard my conversation. She locked the door for me which, at first I didn't notice, but then she even encouraged me after the phone call to talk to someone if I need help and to go to the guidance office and stuff.

I guess, in 
many ways, I regret that I only realized many minutes later that I should've asked for her name. My point is, love is everywhere. It was the kind of unexpected love that really threw me off guard and made me smile despite my overflowing family problems. Life is tough even for the toughest, most indestructible cookie (like I thought I was) but giving love, even to people you don't know, is important. ALSO notice the Ates at school, even those who aren't Ate Alma. They're people, too, and they deserve to be loved as much as we do.

I think the LGBTQ+ community is creating too many terms too fast. I don't want to be misunderstood but here ah. I get that you want to express yourself fully, that not every word used and their meanings can fully describe the complexity of your sexualities and genders but the charge to come up with more words shouldn't be a charge. It should be a slower, methodical, and well thought out process of naming. 
 You're running the risk of literally alienating everyone that's trying to understand. It's starting to sound like a foreign language and what's worse is the language doesn't seem to stop changing. All the new terms being added is putting me off trying to understand. I'm not saying that I'm not trying, I really am but the problem is that it isn't centralized. It's a select few members of the community that's putting in new words when others have words for it already. You can see it right? Even members of the community are getting confused already.  It's beautiful that you can express yourself! But my goodness it has to slow down and reorganize or else it'll just alienate people.","September 28, 2018 6:16:14 AM +08"

 Bottomline is: Don't feel the need to fit in with your block. Try to make friends outside of your block, even if that just means coursemates. And most of all, you don't have to pretend to be someone you're not! You're great the way you are, and you'll find the right people in due time.

"9359","Tbh, idk why people are hating on Nutriasia.

1st, the people on strike aren't Nutriasia employees. They're B-Mirk Enterprise employees, they go to Nutriasia as outsourced workers (Like a call center agent doing work for a client, but is signed under the call center, not the client). Getting mad at Nutriasia is like getting mad at the call center's client because the client refuses to (and tbh, they shouldn't) give the call center employees benefits that 
they aren't entitled to anyway. Since you know... the workers are not the client's employees, they're the call center's... It's B-Mirk's job to ensure that the employees are enjoying benefits from them and are paid well, not Nutriasia. 2nd, the police were the one who beat them up, not Nutriasia.  So why is the hate targeted towards Nutriasia when it should be towards B-Mirk Enterprise and the police? The only sin of Nutriasia here is picking a bad labor provider, nothing more really.","September 27, 2018 9:03:41 PM +08"

Is it because of the temptation? Is it really natural? Is it because of me..? I'm so insecure, the others were so beautiful, stunning even. I used to be confident about how I look and act. Now, I swallow my pride, and I eventually lost the confidence I used to have. I saved up for skincare products, gym fees, diet food, all just to please him. But at the end, it was taken for granted. Everyone tells me I'm nice and friendly and loving

Emailing those who are looking for fubus or fwbs or momol buddies and the like. I felt guilty everytime I typed a message, and I eventually don't reply when they send their reply.  I still love him, and I'm stupid for that. I don't have the heart to break up with him, and I just end up crying to myself. Because I know that the I love you's we exchanged were half meant, because only I meant it.  And if can anyone answer my question above, please do. I'd love to hear others' opinions about this.

 The tweet that became popular said that Ateneo was just a 2nd rate University compared to U.P. https://mobile.twitter.com/piodu…/status/1044147879479111680 I know it's a joke tweet but it reminded  me of that age old discussion of University rankings. In the end, the general rank of your University is a far less important than the rank of your specific course. A minority of U.P students like to brag towards Ateneans, likewise a minority of Ateneans brag against DLSU and so on...but the university rankings are meaningless when you check the board exam passing rate of your specific course. The top 3 medical schools in the country aren't even from the big 4. So course rank is a lot more important than school rank.

Here's a receipt for you.
 A post years ago, by a U.P professor. It got 200+ likes by it's end. Do you think Ateneans generalize U.P students as elitists? Who tell people to ""find a cheap Ateneo or de la Salle girl"" and deliberately exclude UST even though it's med school is just as good as U.P's? No, because we know this was a small minority of people who were mysogynistic and elitists at least at that time. We don't generalize U.P.

I can sort of understand what you're feeling, Anon, although personally I was wide-eyed about OrSem precisely because it was so different from our everyday life, the ""reality"", as you put it. So it's very kind of them to make that effort. My two cents in, however. Part of me wonders where did they go afterwards. The support and love from those people ""without even meeting you"" (from admin's comment). Where was that? 
 Maybe we needed to be shown a realistic picture about where to get support and love. The only way to get that is if you have enough energy and resources to also give back, to also join 100 different extracurricular activities and make a difference. And if you don't? Well, like you said, you'd just be keeping your head down, studying, without really knowing or meeting anyone. (By the way, when I say ""you"", I mean people in general). So I wish there was a way to get support and love without having to give back as much effort, especially when given your personal circumstances (mental health as an example, since you mentioned it in the post), you simply can't. I wish that you didn't have to be like most people, who are strong enough to do things you'd think are amazing, and apparently amazing is average in this school. I wish that you could get what you need even if you are perceivably ""less than average"" in this new environment. Well, I don't know if that is/was possible. I guess I haven't been looking around hard enough. When you graduate though, it'll be over. You can tone it down a notch. You can join more chill or laid back groups or organizations. You can go at your own pace. Finally, and at long last... you can just be yourself again. I guess the problem you have with OrSem isn't because it's unrealistic happiness. The real issue could simply be that this level of love and happiness (from very real people and their very real efforts) simply isn't enough for the difficult, dark world we live in. And it's not their fault, but if we can be made more aware about it, we can all work together and do much better.","May 27, 2018 10:08:43 AM +08"

Somehow, reading the irate comments makes me lonely. I understand that it is at times necessary to fight for big systemic changes.
 As for me however, I think people spend too much time being angry online. I'm glad that some of them chose to educate rather than to belittle.  Being a lonely person, I seek to join communities that help people one by one. Though it's a far cry from the big systemic changes that are being demanded, I am more inclined to the former because I need to see the people who are being helped. I need to know them personally. Otherwise, sometimes I get depressed. Otherwise, my personal needs seem so worthless in comparison to those debated issues from the irate people.

However, I still can't see people caring for who I am, that I can be proud of myself. I can not see how people see me positively, yet I'm at least content with knowing
 that I am not viewed in a bad light. I used to be extremely negative about myself - I thought that nobody would like me or that I am under a microscope all the time. I thought that people felt pity about me and that I was a miserable piece o fshit. I felt bad when I told people about myself in fear of oversharing. I felt bad about what I liked because it's a niche thing to do. Tonight felt different though. It felt like those weights were gone for a little while. I'm somewhat fearful for tomorrow when I sober up.

I don't really want to snob them, though. I think maybe, bit by bit I can just be that presence of peace they can go to and rant about stuff and then maybe they'd get influenced by my calmness as well?

 Sorry, I'm not trying to sound holier-than-thou. I just honestly believe that people who are given to rage are... not really at the best place they can be.
 I've been through shit in my life but I guess I'm lucky I've been exposed to the right resources (usually online and other reading materials, rather than other people... well, actually including a few people, so I'm grateful!!)

So It's been a rough time for me. I'm trying my best to get above average grades (above 3) because I wanna show that I can actually pull of the grades my peers are pulling off.

You don't always get a second chance. It's a fact of life. Technically, you already had many.
 And if you love someone, you respect their decisions. You don't put your needs first. It's true and well that you are heartbroken, and that it's ""unfair"" to not be given a second chance considering you're a better person now, and that you deserve to seek support from people around you, but that doesn't have to be at the expense of someone else's freedom. If they made the decision to forgive you, no one would have interfered. There was only interference from outsiders because the original decision from that person (to end it) was not respected.  You haven't really grown if you're still heavily dependent on one person. That it HAS to be that one person, and no one else. Come on. You know better. Please share if relevant.

Apparently blue collar workers in Ateneo (ex. Janitor) are payed 20,000 pesos as a starting salary.
 After 6 years they get 40,000 pesos. After 12 years, they get 80,000 pesos. These rates were before the union protest and I'm not really sure what the rates are now, but she said that 4-5 mil pesos was allocated to the wages of the union members (which was proportional to the population percentage of the union members). Ateneo raised the wage offer to 8.6 mil, the union members wanted 12 mil.  The protests are over but I don't know whether 8.6 or 12 million pesos ended up becoming the new budget allocation towards the union members. Teachers and other faculty may even start making a union for themselves because of the recent protests and budget allocation. This is really really surprising and I wan't to know if it's true.","February 24, 2018 3:06:49 PM +08"

 THIS IS NOT A CLICKBAIT TITLE
 The reason this worked on me was because I spent time checking on other people to see if they could notice the tiniest details that I ""improved"" about myself. But little did I know that those tiny details don't matter either. Especially because I didn't actually improve myself. I just tried to appear like I improved. I didn't just go into solitude, isolated, and do the work and make my life better. I went to other people because I thought they could fill a void that I was feeling within myself.

Seriously, he would claim to break down, threaten to hang himself for weeks, and call his ex every word in the book like 'manipulative' or 'asshole' when he's the one who has been technically harassing her.... I feel sorry for his ex. Instead of forgetting his said ex and focus on family for Christmas he would tweet nonstop about being cheated on and wanting to die when everyone knows it's not even close to true. He has been guilt tripping other friends to feel bad for him and hate the ex, has been posting every single meltdown (it has gotten tiring, thinking of cutting him off already) and kept posting pictures of his ex erased badly with broken hearts.... Honestly? It was creepy already, borderline stalking.  To anyone who has broken up with their SO before the holidays, chin up and know your worth, because subtweeting about that said SO nonstop for months is obviously not going to help.

"43","Long story short, it was very dangerous for me to create an online-based group when I have a very strong internet addiction.

If I didn't make this group, maybe I'd be in a totally different direction. Maybe a lot of the meaningful things that happened to me in the past year would never have happened. Because I met so many people online. And they were meaningful encounters. Not just shallow ones. They were meaningful because I met up with some of them offli
ne. And some of them are potentially meaningful because there's still a whole bunch of others I have not met up with yet but they are interested to do so. One person was more special in particular. Even that person is not part of the online group. That just goes to show how extensive my online efforts really were. That there were other encounters separate from this one big group. So I don't know. If I did not do this, would I still be in a bad place? Or would I be a new person already, considering I might have solved my internet addiction and became a totally different person just from having that sort of 100% digital detox? I'm bad at meeting people offline, in classrooms, orgs, and other settings. Or I WAS bad. I've improved quite a bit but I don't really think I'm super good yet. If I was, I wouldn't still be addicted to the internet. That is why if I did not make this online group (and all the other individual encounters that were separate from the group), maybe I would have felt like progress was super slow. But maybe that is the necessary thing I just have to deal with. Maybe I'm underestimating what a 100% digital detox would do. (Okay, realistically, more like 90%. I still need to keep up with acads or use facebook to plan offline events) I'm conflicted, okay? I'm thinking ""I've gone this far, should I really do a complete overturning of strategy NOW?"" Is it damned if I do, damned if I don't?","December 8, 2017 3:42:55 PM +08"
"42","Hello umm my girlfriend and I started out together in school (obvs since that's where we met hahaha). We would walk around late after our last classes just wandering and talking. Thing is, we've never had our first kiss. Personally, I don't like PDA, but she thought that it might be sweet to do it in school one night since it's where we started out. We were wondering if there were places to kiss in private around campus, or is it a bad idea altogether to have a first kiss in school? Really not trying to show off please don't get the wrong idea. I hope this didn't come off as pathetic or anything.","December 8, 2017 2:50:41 PM +08"
"41","Being alone helped me for a while. I think it's because I got to know myself more and I was able to improve myself in the background, before going out to meet people. When I did meet people, I still had a lot of mistakes and embarrassed myself so I still needed to take another hiatus and then try again after months or so. The hiatuses really help because I take time to process what I might have done wrong and then with the next group I try, I feel that the 
years have matured me. Please do this, friend. Improve yourself while you are still alone. But don't make that hiatus forever. With all things, there is a balance. Maybe you pushed too hard.  The best part is when the cycles of pushing and hiatus become smaller and they start becoming ""micro-cycles""
 That is what is happening to me now.
 I still have ""micro-hiatuses"" because I still get minor stings from making a mistake socially. But then I'm just glad to have this rapid cycling as my progress is faster this way. Faster than when I pushed very very hard then had to have longer hiatuses.  Think strategically, about this friend. There ARE logics to these kinds of things. It seems strange because it's a normal thing people go through to interact with other people. But even things like these involve ""skill"" and ""strategy"" I'm really sorry I keep writing this. I'm better at expressing myself through writing. I am not trying to be distant.","December 8, 2017 9:54:21 AM +08"
"40","Friend, I think you've been exposed to too much rants. I think you read too much bad news.
The world is as it is. But you don't have to keep updated every single second.
Only read stuff that are relevant to the betterment of your life.

 And the betterment of your life DOES include the common good. It DOES include eventually making the world a better place.
 But you cannot make it better until you make yourself strong enough that you stop loathing yourself and you stop loathing the world!
 Only when you're a certain level of confident (you improved your life to a ""normal"" level, you don't have to be the wealthiest or powerful) can you effect change in this world! People will not listen to your desire to change the world if you're being a freaking asshole TO YOURSELF. Because what you're showing people is you don't know how to help people because you don't try to understand or empathize with yourself!  You have lived your difficult life for the longest time, IKAW ang EXPERT sa buhay mo >:( 
 And your difficulty is at that constant, stable level na. Dinadagdag mo lang sa thoughts mo, sa statements mo na you don't deserve better. Putang ina reach for help.  Sorry ha? I'm doing what I can so that I can be in a better position to help you, pero limited lang mabibigay ko sa ngayon. Kung ano ang sinabi ko sa'yo ngayon, sinasabi ko rin sa sarili ko. To other people: Huwag mo palaging gayahin ang paraan ko na pag-usap sa friend ko. It's a case to case basis. This was just what my intuition told me. That kailangan niya ng tough love. Eh yung iba, kailangan lang nila ng listener. Not advice, just listener. Eh yung kausap kong ito, hindi siya yung type na gusto magkwento so... basta.  Bakit ko pinost? Eh para nga someone else could benefit. I tried to tell naman in person. I'll see where it goes from here, pero sa ngayon, I don't have an opportunity to say this just yet. Nahirapan ako to talk to this person in person. For now, I need to think about this.","December 8, 2017 8:43:49 AM +08"
"39","To my friend (I'm only posting this in case others could benefit):
I'm going to say something very epal. Tough love.
 Improve yourself. Acquire hobbies or interests that other people like. Doesn't matter if you're not interested in them or you don't like them. I can see the one interest that you have that stays constant: to have friends, to make life better. There is a psychological concept, but I forgot what it's called, when you start liking something just by being exposed to it. If mainstream movies are not for you, find not mainstream movies (a lot of people are into those as well). It's a sad world that we live in that WE are the ones who have to adapt to others. It will be a two way effort. Once you're very confident then people will start adapting to you. But you can only be confident by adapting first with the major aspects. It's a cycle, chicken and egg. Exercise. Start very very small, but be consistent. You won't see the effect right away, but damn, you're going to have more energy than you ever expected. You'll start having a ""new normal"" and it'll affect how you talk to other people and how you do your work. I hate to say this considering you also have an illness, but please fix your attitude. You talk to yourself negatively. You talk as if you don't deserve good things and that's YOUR FUCKING CHOICE. The world is unfair but FUCKING FIGHT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER.  I sometimes have that same shitty attitude, but damn, I try to stop it!!! Hindi ka ba nasasawa diyan?? Just observe how other people act, gestures, tone of voice, mimic that!!! That is what I fucking did and that is how I started feeling happier around people. Like attracts like. And I changed myself. That is the point. I CHANGED MYSELF. Now don't pilosopo me about how maybe that means you're not being ""authentic."" The SELF, the EGO, is an illusion! We're just moving bags of meat! Now adapt so you can enjoy what little time you have!!! If you want tips on the gestures, tone of voice, etc. part. Ask me! You know who I am. Basta. Pucha kasi eh.  I sat down with you a couple of times and I'm not always enjoying because of your negative attitude towards yourself. I chose to sit down because I know you're worth it. It's not about taking some kind of benefit for myself. Love does not always feel good. But I can only have so much patience.","December 8, 2017 8:26:41 AM +08"

I am a very emotional person. The only time I am least emotional is when I am ""hypnotized"" by the internet. I guess that is why I have been addicted to the internet and to video games for the longest time. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was addiction.
 My emotions make me want to find someone who feels the same way. I am the opposite of manhid. But almost everyone around me is part of the culture of manhid.
 I keep daydreaming of how close friendships or even relationships are like. I wonder if I am very unrealistic. I imagine strong emotions are involved. And so I guess I don't succeed with finding people like me, because maybe my imagination is unrealistic. Part of me wants to keep these emotions alive. I want to quit the internet. I want to be more adventurous. I want to do more embarrassing things. And then feel the resulting emotions from that. It's so difficult but I just need to fucking improve myself. Maybe my emotions are not wrong. Maybe it was my numbing addictions that kept me at a safe distance from people. Maybe people truly feel strong emotions in their close relationships, but the difference is that they only chose people who were mature enough from having expressed those emotions for a long, long time. In contrast, when I express my emotions, they are too raw and sometimes hurt other people. I have not matured because I have been numbing myself for the longest time. The difficult thing is how I aim to mature myself. It would entail going out there and meeting people. But I don't want to hurt people just for the sake of maturing myself! I don't know what to do anymore. I have definitely started expressing these emotions and I wonder if people think I'm O.A. or too sensitive or whatever. But I just really, really want to find connection.","December 7, 2017 10:51:25 AM +08"

Is it really possible to find a best friend or barkada in Ateneo when:

 1. everyone (around you) has heavy workload (if acads are easy for them, they still fill it up to the brim with org work and other activities) 
 2. when majority of people (around you) are no longer looking for that BFF or barkada because they already found them
 3.  when you have lower than average social skills I'm graduating. I have had no luck. The only thing good that happened to me regarding this topic is that my social skills have really improved and I meet more people. But I just wonder when I will ever feel like I belong somewhere. I know I can do this after grad, but I just want to know if there's anything I can still do before graduating.

Ever since i entered college, never have i ever felt so lonely in my life. I had high hopes of starting fresh and making new friends/barkadas when i entered college but those hopes have died. My block is too divided and the worst part is im in the division. They dont dislike me but they dont particularly like me either. Some of my classmates i enjoy spending time with, but we only really spend time together in class. Most of the time theyd 
rather go with their other friends after class. This is probably the worst kind of loneliness. The one where Im surrounded by people and yet i still feel alone. I meet so many new people but for some reason i still feel alone. I try and try to become closer to them but its like no matter how hard i try to reach out, theyre just too high for me to reach. At this point, im tired of trying and maybe ill just accept this lonely life of mine. Hopefully theres more in store for next sem.","December 1, 2017 12:23:10 AM +08"

Hi! I am among the supporting admins of the first RantBox.
 If you know the person that had just had his account down, you probably know who he is. I am speaking here right now. Okay. I would probably be not be an active admin anymore, because I had my account down because of a RantBox post that made FB be a basis for its deletion. I...am now scared that this might happen to the newer version. I am speaking from another account, as of the moment. I had to, since not doing this would not make me keep updated with academics.  However, I fear more on what happens after this semester. I may not be of importance, yet Ateneo needs a lot of bug fixes. A LOT. Lots of issues have been ranted already
  The Covered Courts parking. UAAP tickets fiasco. The old Residence Halls. Scientific equipment. Are they still be left to rot? I doubt they'd be upgraded. The bureaucracy's still up there. And from the lessons of my last roleplay... The power of the institution is from the students per se.  We need more than just talking to the admin about this. We need to make sure  the admin is constantly caring for their source of power: us students. That is our job, aside from studying and getting that diploma.","November 30, 2017 9:27:43 PM +08"
