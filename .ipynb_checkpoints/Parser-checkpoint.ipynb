      "I think the reason why we really hate Filipino in college is not because of the language, but the topics in it. I’d understand if Filipino was about learning how to speak deeper Tagalog, learning like street tagalog culture, or anything related at our present times. \n",
      "Instead college Filipino (at least what i experienced here) for me had very unnecessary or lack of better term, useless topics. Lol So in Filipino, we learn about a girl falling in love with nature getting horny, we learn about the ancient Filipinos and their super weird cultures, and we are REQUIRED to memorize authors of books that we’ll probably never read again. What I’m trying to say is that these topics are not very applicable in our present society. Sure i can understand a girl loves nature, sure i can study about the ancient Filipino culture, sure i can memorize random authors names, BUT in the end, after I graduate, I’m sure all these things I learned will be forgotten simply because they’re useless. It’s not very applicable in life to talk about authors I memorized lol. I guess thats why people are against the Filipino subject. It’s not because Filipino sucks, it’s more because the topics being taught are really useless... Submitted:  November 23, 2018 10:33:48 AM +08\n",

      "I feel you guys. I’m an oldie of the org I assume you are referring to and to be honest I only remained a member because a) I still somehow love my work, and b) I still have very very good friends in the org. Yes they are VERY cliquish. What completely sucks is that there is a sense of “coldness” between the cast and the production teams. Hell cast members don’t even say hi to you when you say hi to them in the theater. For fuck’s sake one time, after I’d just finished doing the show for lights, I stepped out and they told me “Thank you for watching!” as of I were part of the audience. They didn’t even know I’d been there for literally almost every show. This was done to me 4 TIMES. 4 fucking times like holy shit di niyo ba ako kilala or something I try to say hi to you people every fucking time.  To all the people who defend the org and say “Just go to HR. They’re there for a reason,” this isn’t a simple “HR” problem. There’s a problem with how the org has been systematically. There is a lot of nepotism. Some people get positions that they don’t deserve but only get because they’re friends with the PMs. For example, I once applied to be the part of a mainstage second semester production. Prior to applying, I had done 3 org productions, 3 productions for another org, and I’d even done professional work outside of Ateneo. Basically, and not to boast, I was THE ONE for the job. I didn’t get it. Instead, someone who was close with the PM and whose only experience in Technicals was working in set & props got the job. It was incredibly frustrating.  That being said, to the two newbies who have spoken out, I implore you to stay not because of the people. Stay for the craft. It can’t be denied that said org still has great productions (despite a lot of backstage frustration) and the performers are still among the best in the school and even in the Philippines. Love your work. It doesn’t mean you have to love the people along the way. Screw them. Submitted:  November 23, 2018 7:19:00 AM +08\n",

      "I LOVE my class so much, but sometimes I just feel like they're like vanilla ice cream and my friends and I in my small friend group are like the fun flavors like cookies and cream, rocky road, etc. The rest of them can just be such a fucking bore. Like I don't hate them I just feel like sometimes I wanna say/do something crazy and outlandish but because of their sweet vanilla nature, they'd just smile and say \"um no it's fine\" and pretend it never happened. So right now I'm just trying to be friends with them because they really are genuine and nice people they can just be so bland, boring and basic most of the time.\n",

      "\n",
      "THIS POST WAS MADE TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT NETWORKING AND HOW FRAUDULENT THEIR REPS ARE I know it's not good to generalize but there was this brand (rhymes with MuSkeen) who invited me for a meeting about a job opening in my field. Already skeptical about it, I told them that I'll think about it. Joke's on me for worrying to come off as impolite if I say no.  When the day came that he followed up for my confirmation, I straight up asked the person if it was a network marketing event. He literally said NO THAT IT WASNT. Believing him, I went to the meeting because I trusted him. THAT'S WHERE I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.  The speakers of the event were going on about how \"Network Marketing was the best way to earn money\" UGH FUQ IVE BEEN LIED TO AND I FELL FOR IT  I'm already laughing at myself for falling for this. But I'm sharing this experience to y'all AS A CAUTIONARY TALE to avoid people messaging you about a \"business venture\" or a \"business opportunity\", take everything with a grain of salt. If they won't tell you what brand they're working for, don't waste more time entertaining these shady people. If you already think they're dodgey, trust your gut. If you can't find them on the first page of Google, don't even think about it. Network marketers/pyramid scheme scammers make people on the higher wrungs richer. They're stigmatized for a reason. All these skincare/health pharma things may be the bread and butter to some but I hope these people DONT LIE TO PEOPLE JUST SO THEY CAN GET THEIR WAY. It's not impolite to step away when you realize it's a fraudulent invitation.  That's 2.5 hours of my life that I won't get back.

      "I believe school has conditioned us to be perfectionists; excelling not for the purpose of learning and improvement, but from the fear of failure and inadequacy.

      "PUTTING THE SOSE THEORY TO THE TEST: Who is richer, the average SOH major or the average SOSE major? The SOSE supremacist would contend that SOH majors are rich and so could afford to be SOH majors where the average SOH job pays less than the average SOSE job. Emphasis on average: Do not go into tails! I mean average in the same way you cannot cross a river just because it is on average 3 feet deep. On the other hand, parents of lower net worth will be more inclined to sway their kids towards SOSE, not necessarily just out of highschool but from the very beginning of the kids' lives. Thus, the kids are not forced into SOSE. Rather, the kids are shown the wonders of math and science from their birth. SOH majors' parents are likely rich or SOH majors themselves.\n",

He also sends people to the \"UN\" and asks for a crazy amount of money too. I heard the participants of his \"training program\" for this \"UN thing\" always have a ton of complaints because it's not run well.  Is this what Ateneo taught us? Is this \"development\" or is Scammy S just using people and barangays for money? Oh and Scammy S also likes to take credit for his team's work without doing any of the actual work. He just likes the photo ops in high level places so he looks cool. I think three full core teams have quit under him because of his lack of professionalism. Come on, Scammy S!

      "Okay so here's an update from an FW post I submitted back in September (7394, for reference). Palapit na ang finals, and for some reason I am still so fuckin attracted to my classmate that I found super duper cute?? Like wth patapos na yung sem tapos wala naman nangyayari. Bobo lang ako. Now I just kinda hate him because wala tangina gusto ko pa rin siya huhu. I gave up on trying to be halaman altogether, but I also kinda gave up on him at some point kasi sobrang wala kaming common friend circles at common activities except that one class we have together. And I was super obvious with him and got the feel na sinusungitan niya ako ergo di siya interested. Tapos out of nowhere kinausap niya ako after class??!?! As in I know that's nbd pero isipin mo. Isipin mo yung sobrang crush na crush mo isang tao tapos sinungitan ka nila, tapos kumbinsado ka na ayaw na ayaw nila sayo tapos biglang kakausapin ka nila?? Naku kuya mahirap yan. I'm so Maropoque™. Kaya ayan naloka ako all over again. Tumingin ulit ako sa horoscope para lang may reference ako of some sort na kung type ba ng sign niya yung girl yung magmamake ng first move?? Honestly sobrang bobo ko lang. Like, am I really gonna base my actions on his natal chart? Tbh probably but sobrang ???  Apparently his sign will try anything once, so I was kinda banking on that?? But ayun, recently, I decided okay fine- I'll ask him out. Fuck it. I'm gonna do it. What's the worst that could happen? I've been rejected several times before. I can handle it.  And I started telling people na parang okay I'm gonna do it, kahit na sobrang mukhang cannot be, susubukan ko kasi I will never know for sure. After asking for some advice, I figured sige I can build up talking to him for a few times muna after class before really asking him out, kahit one meeting lang. So ayun hinahype ko sarili ko, kakausapin ko siya after class.  Ito na. Ito na. Tapos alam mo yung sa movies, yung hahabulin na ng main character yung gusto nila tapos biglang pag nag-pan na yung camera may kasamang iba AGOYYYYYY There was a girl waiting for him na, and they walked together. And like ang sakit mga pare bro. As in feel ko naman tropa lang sila pero alam mo yung sobrang naramdaman ko lang lalo na magka-ibang mundo kami and sobrang longshot talaga. And parang he has enough girls around him, and hindi kami same crowd, so di rin ako tugma sa personality ng mga girls that he usually hangs around.  But also for some reason parang this is the third time since freshman year na I've seen this same girl with a guy I like and parang ate girl tulong how?? Tapos ex ata siya ng orsem crush ko, so wow an extra oof. Oof lang talaga.  Submitted:  November 22, 2018 2:33:55 AM +08\n",

      "Everybody has a story behind that cigarette that they smoke. Some people smoke because they think its cool, some people smoke because its part of their routine, but the reason i smoke is because of a girl. A girl whom i love so much it hurts, the urge to see and talk to her is always there. The smile from her angelic face never fails to make me feel loved. But of course where there is light, there is darkness ; it hurts when you feel no comfort from anyone. When the love of your life is no longer yours you feel like nothing matters. She doesnt even care about what you do anymore, she hurt you like you were no one to her. Also Imagine getting betrayed by your friends when you treated them like family yeah that happened to me too. I would even die for them or even help them hide a dead body if they needed me to. Everything hurts to the point you’re numb and you don’t even know yourself anymore. Sometimes you just dont know eho to trust and lean on. That is where my cigarette comes in, it comforts me whenever i feel alone and unwanted. It just makes you forget about the problems that you have as if it comes with the smoke that you release from between your lips. So guys whenever you see a smoker just ask him/her about his/her life dont judge him or her right away because you never know the story behind that burnt cigarette.

      "How do you know if you have depression or if you're just thinking too much about things? As much as I'd like to feel better, I don't want to see a doctor/therapist/counselor just to find out I'm overstating my problems. Lately I've just been feeling generally down and that there isn't any point to anything. In the end, we all just die, and trying to \"find meaning\" in things just feels like hedonism to me. Sure, I can be happy and enjoy myself at times, but I don't know if that's just a distraction from how empty I feel. I feel that I can't relate with anyone. Why does it seem like everyone in Ateneo has so many friends and good relationships with other people, while I am just superficially connected to everyone? There are many of the little projects like JSEC challenge/SOM event case studies that need groups but I've never been able to be part of those because it just seems I'm not close enough to anyone to be invited to a group. I don't want burden people with my feelings, and I'd rather listen to other people and help them out, but no one tells me anything. I don't know how my blockmates can talk to each other so casually and, y'know, connect, when any conversation I start gets killed because it seems no one wants to talk to me.  It's like no one wants to know me. Maybe I'm just thinking too much. Everybody knows me as the super extroverted guy that isn't afraid to do anything, the guy with all the jokes and with the boundless energy and a mystic energy source that makes him always feel good. Heck, I even was a TNT back at OrSem.  I guarantee anyone who knows my name and has met me more than a couple of times will be surprised if they find out I wrote this. guess we all just have problems Submitted:  November 21, 2018 11:38:17 AM +08\n",

Don't get me wrong, it's important too as things like Iraq were wrong, but I'm pretty sure a country which aims to say that an entire SEA is their exclusive property, including areas only 50 miles away from Palawan, is more important.  Sure, these types of people post US-China-Duterte triumvirate regime posters/graffiti thinking that Xi Jinping is secretly teamed up with Trump or some other flat Earth tier belief but atleast they're finally focusing more on this joke of a map.  Seriously, everyone should. Like this is straight up imperialism, and it's not happening in some other continent, it's happening a few dozen miles away from Palawan. This is not okay.

      "On a serious note, THANKS MIGUEL!!! I know a lot of girls (and guys) are hopping on your D in the group chat right now but let me cowardly tell you on the FW that you’re GENUINELY one of the nicest/sweetest people I’ve met in our course. Please remember that and hold on to it. The type of personality you have is very rare and it’s just as valuable as your ginormous brain. The world needs more kind people like you. Thanks for everything!!! (not just for the reviewer 🤗) ❤️ Sincerely,\n",

      "Wanted to give an FAIR AND UNBIASED opinion on the recent PANA post in AFW. I am not trying to put down anyone, but would want to give credit to PUP the declared winner of the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, I have a couple of friends part of the team and I know the coaches of the ADMU team and they had no doubts on the results. Something that strikes me more is the fact that the post was shared by 400+ people, but interestingly, among my friends only students from one school shared it and felt strongly against it. While this is obviously the likely outcome since they were the most affected, the proof that Ateneans generally agree with the results is a strong statement in itself. Second, I rewatched the video of PUP and it was really amazing. No doubt that UP also had an amazing presentation, but PUP's plans was really focused and targeted. PUP vs the Ateneo's and UP's showed amazing art vs just showing science. While marketing is heavily dependent on science, at the end of the day science will only bring you so far, it is art that changes the game. I am 100% sure that PUP's art is the real deal. Third, it seems super fishy that the post was super focused and looked like it was written by someone heavily involved in the competition. As an Atenean SOM student who is active in competitions and has a lot of friends in competitions, I can be sure when I say that Ateneans are not as involved unless the ones competing or contributing. This post was probably written by someone really invested or had friends that were really invested. Going back to the first point it seems like the Ateneans really involved here have denied the allegations.  Fourth, the judges are all credible and are huge in the marketing organization. This does not mean they are not prone to fraud, but it also means that they have no gain already and most of them aren't doing this for money but they really believe in the future of marketing. In summary, I'm not saying that the post is false. That's the beauty and ugly of anonymity. We can never be too sure. However, given the points above, it is unfair to PUP that there are lots of bashers. We need to give credit where it is due. PUP was great. Whether you believed they were the best or not is your opinion. For the sets of judges, and for a lot of other students, PUP was the clear winner.  Submitted:  November 20, 2018 10:42:56 PM +08\n",

      "i can't help but feel bad for couples who have the \"above/under\" type of dynamic wherein either one of them is very strong in terms of personality, while the other leans toward the more passive side. inevitably, there will always be someone who is dominant/ submissive in a relationship, but what gets really scary is when for example, the girl (or the boy of course) gets EXTREMELY  controlling of her partner to the point where the partner is all but a  small little dog that follows her around, gets too scared when she gets mad, and gets anxiety attacks whenever he thinks he did something wrong. it gets really sad because even if you want to tell them that there is something wrong with the dynamic, you can't help but realize that the \"under\" does it out of love. At what point do we draw the line between saying that it is okay to do it out of love, and saying that the girl, is simply too toxic for the boy and simply abuses his kindness?   again, this can conversely happen the other way around wherein the male is the more dominant figure and that the female gets treated and taken advantage of simply because she was kind.  hoping for some great feedback!

      "I am very disappointed with whoever is handling this year’s ID party finances. For one, sobrang supot ng party. But that’s not where this is coming from entirely. When I first saw the ID seniors posting about their deck of cards I thought na ang mahal niya. 650 for a deck of cards? Pero sige pagbigyan kasi nga naman diba support artists. Only to find out when I asked a friend kung nakakakuha ba sila ng comission ay aba, wala. 650 and none of the artists gets anything. Funds daw para sa party. Seems a bit unethical. Even worse is nakita ko yung quality ng cards kasi may kaibigan akong bumili... sana ako na lang pumrint. Hindi po ganoon ka mahal magprint ng ganung quality. Ibig sabihin sobrang laki ng patong sa cards, hindi pumupunta sa artists, at pumunta sa napakasupot na party. Very disappointing ID seniors, but the ones who are managing the finances especially.

      " tbh, it’s so evident that it’s just you guys who gives this big of a shit for this whole thing? like damn, chill out. get over it.  Why can’t we just be happy for a school that doesn’t win so often? Personally, the PUP win was expected. Yes, the judges’ comments were off at times, and yes UP’s presentation was no doubt some great shit… but PUP’s was overall the most realistic and doable campaign. Offhand, UP’s campaign seemed like a tourism campaign that just inserted sustainability. PUP’s campaign effectively highlighted the sustainability aspect. YES, the jingle was their strong point.. but really, realistically, a jingle goes a long way especially with their target market. I see how the judges could really lean towards their campaign.  “If we lose to a fucking jingle, tangina lang.” - UP PANA team member heard outside Irwin.  Please stop being such obnoxious and entitled people with this. When the PUP team won, the least you could have done was to try to be happy for them. Crying on stage and making a scene at the side or Irwin after the awarding was just so tasteless. It reflects so much on how entitled you are. We get that you always win. Sadly, it seems to have gotten to your head. Para kayong mga bata eh, mga iyakin.  It was not in losing to PUP that you lost your pride. It was in how you reacted when you got second place. With the way you acted, and are acting to invalidate their win, you are a disgrace to the marketing community. Nakakahiya kayo and it’s disgusting. In this case, you are definitely not deserving of winning.  Please get off your high horse, get your heads out of your asses, and get off of our freedom wall. Stop using ADMU’s platform for your dirty shit.  SIT DOWN. BE HUMBLE.  If you can’t take losing, then don’t join the competition.

      "I totally agree haha I actually noticed the lady judge was embarrassing all the teams. I remember how UP Visayas had an amazing race as an execution and part of it was doing/making a bonfire. She even told them how bonfires were illegal and they should have done their homework to know that it's illegal. Pero when PUP recommended Laboracay 2.0, which again, was already illegal, she just laughed it off and gave a sarcastic comment. If that isn't bias then idk what is. I hope the other people who were there speak up as well. If PUP believes that they deserve that award, they should be willing to have PANA post all the videos. If not, then that says a lot. :) Submitted:  November 20, 2018 1:25:03 AM +08\n",

I never said produced shit output. If you go back to my post you'd see I actually commended them and their campaign. I'm attacking the mechanism and the \"system\" that runs in that organization. Para matapos na lahat, I just want PANA to post the criteria, the videos of all the presentations, and the breakdown of scores. I'm sure everyone would appreciate that. If PUP is certain that they check off all the criteria then what's there to fear? I understand the fact that the scoring may be objective to some extent but for things that you can clearly quantify, like say specific marketing technicalities, dun talaga magkakatalo. Both teams presented great campaigns, it's just that as for marketing technicalities, the other really stood out clearly. A video including the Q&A would be great too. That's where you'll see how the judges didn't grill PUP at all when there were lots of things that can possibly be questioned vs all the rest of the teams, not just UP. Everyone else was grilled for the algorithms of their apps/sites etc, for the sustainability aspect. Accountability and transparency, PANA. That wouldn't be difficult to give if everything was well-deserved. I hope all PANA teams encourage this for the sake of transparency. :) Submitted:  November 20, 2018 1:16:06 AM +08\n",

These people play basketball because it's an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because it's what they want, it's what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids aren't playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country won't produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldn't even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but I'd rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they don't give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball won't turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you can't convince a person who loves Kyrie Irving's insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal.

I may look so calm from the outside, but there's a constant war inside of me all the time. My heart keeps telling me to talk to you, but my body won't let me. I cry everyday out of frustration. I hate myself for being so shy. I think: \"Why can't I talk like a normal person??\".  I think, if I wasn't just so shy, we could be closer by now. We're always working together, yet I still feel so awkward.  *sigh*.  The sem is almost over and I'm afraid that we might never see each other anymore. But one's thing for sure, I will never forget your beautiful smile that never fails to  brighten up my day. And you're so cute with the way you constantly fix your hair.

It’s not like a chill free spirited type of “I don’t care” it’s a more of cold apathy. If something goes even the slightest bit out of his favor, he’ll pretty much leave you instead of trying to fix it and work things out. Case and point, he’s not a nice guy. He’s not that caring. And that sucks for me because I’m trying to keep this friendship alive. I’m trying to get everyone’s heads straight and show them that they need to change. But it’s slowly tugging away my sanity.

      "So you fucked up. So what? You're worried that people will judge you, but so what if they do? In time, this incident will be forgotten, or over time will become a memory to laugh at. I was worried, you know? For the better part of the day you weren't your normal, cheery/sleepy/sabog/excitable self - you were more like me: quiet, sober, and looked depressed. I would have asked if you were ok, but i'm shy and didn't want to disturb you.  I just want to say, that even though you fucked up, it will be fine; in a few days, no one will remember that incident, and you can move on. So chin up! the day moves on. And if ever you're feeling down and/or want to talk, I'm always just a short message away. Cheers!\n",

      "In 1987, the Yatabe Test Circuit was the place to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many different tuners testing their luck out there, and so the place was filled with race-tuned JDM legends ready to take a shot at hitting 200mph/320kph. Most of the cars being tested on the circuit back then were Nissan creations, specifically those from the Z lineup and the Skyline lineup. To see a car from another manufacturer was a little unheard of then. So when the RE Amemiya team came to the circuit one day, it was a move that few expected. But what happened that day is something that only the team had really anticipated for. In 1987, RE Amemiya became legend for setting one of the fastest time records that Yatabe has ever seen. But how? It was with the FORTIS RX-7 that magic happened. Using a combination of 13 years of Rotary engine tuning experience and carefully crafted parts (a majority of which were created by RE Amemiya themselves) the car had its power output increased to 440PS. And so it was on that fateful day that the fast yet stable FORTIS RX-7 was able to hit a top speed of 315.1km/h, a record in Yatabe for both rotary and non-rotary cars alike. Extremely proud of the results, RE-Amemiya participated in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon, where the car won a grand prize in the auto salon's tuned car division.\n",
      " Because of the FORTIS RX-7's success on both the track and the show, RE Amemiya decided to revamp her for the following year, strengthening her in both aspects. 1988 turned out to be both a good year and a bad year for the car, as though the FORTIS RX-7 failed to set any new records in \n",
      " Yatabe, the car won the Tudor Card Excellence Award in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon.  It was in 1988 where the trail ended though.  The last records that I could find for the car was from that year, and then the following year in 1989, the trail goes cold. Nobody knows the whereabouts of the car, and even those who were possibly actively searching then most likely came up empty-handed. In fact, aside from a single page that showcases the car's spec list and its achievements, RE Amemiya seems to have mostly forgotten about the car, especially in light with their later tuning achievements like the Super GT GT300 RX7. If it weren't for a certain Japanese Tuner Magazine's video, I probably wouldn't have even knew that this ever existed!  But here it is. I don't know how I found it, but I sure am glad I am to be able to share this forgotten piece of history with you guys. Just looking at the pics made me realize that the car would still look dope even today. Enjoy!  Submitted:  November 19, 2018 12:21:19 AM +08\n",

      "This is my opinion but I think that an underlying problem with ADMU is that it discourages its students from walking around, given how certain important buildings like Bellarmine Hall and ISO are located FAR AWAY from where most of the Loyola School (LS) buildings are clustered. Meanwhile the really niche buildings like PIPAC, the freshman dorm halls (Cervini/Eliazo), and even the ASOG are located closer to LS. It's why students complain a lot about their BEL-CTC scheds and you can't blame them since they were probably batch 2 and were forced to pick those BEL classes next to their CTC classes. In any case, it still doesn't take away my point that the way ADMU has been planned has been quite crap. Instead of devoting so much money on creating more and maintaining existing parking spaces and encouraging students to bring their cars, they should've just focus on relocating the important buildings like cafeterias and BEL/FA ANNEX buildings closer to the LS area. This would've perhaps lead students to rely less on their cars, which will eventually reduce the need for parking spaces, and use those other remaining spaces as ports for trikes and other public transpo. That way, that remaining space will take up even less space compared to the already existing parking spaces. Even so, it would also help create more space for more trees = more shade = relatively cooler campus. At the very least I do hope they could at least make their existing buildings more \"green\" (though I'm not saying that in a Lasallian way). I mean, allowing vertical gardens to be a thing in the existing building clusters like Leong Hall, Rizal Libs, Soc Sci, De La Costa, etc.  Regardless, what Ateneo should be doing is making its campus even more pedestrian friendly, since in all honesty, it's one of the best campuses to stroll around.  Thus, making it more \"walkable\" will perhaps help ease out the traffic outside Katipunan. #UrbanPlanningADMU  Submitted:  November 18, 2018 5:42:52 PM +08\n",

      "How does it feel that you have been working hard to help somebody but he/she does not appreciate for what you have done? Well I have been feeling like that kanina while I was being used for printing and cutting out business cards. It was around 10am when my brother asked me to print out 17 sheets of business cards (9 per sheet) on a short bond paper ole he was at a bazaar. So I printed 10 sheets on a wrong paper since it was too thin. Then, I printed another 17 on another paper that’s somewhat thicker, spent my time cutting then according to those outlines of the cards, and arranging in an orderly manner. (Of course I didn’t cut them all yet since I also had to work on my deliverable for my major) When he arrived home, he saw that I was cutting and stacking them. He was glad until my mom pointed out that the paper I used was too thin for a business card. I’m a college undergrad and I don’t have an internship yet so don’t expect me to find a specific kind of paper for that. Another is that he didn’t mention what kind of short bond paper he wanted me to use (carboard paper) so I have nothing to be ashamed of. Seriously, galit na ako ah and I have other things to do other than your pathetic business cards. I was really planning to do a report and my project deliverable on the same day. I’m tired na and I don’t want to cram UGH. If you would have told me the night before, I would set my time to do it. But now, it’s like I don’t want to help you anymore. I’m not being used as a business slave. 😡😡 Submitted:  November 18, 2018 12:28:59 AM +08\n",

      "Personally, I think that philosophy, even if it requires a lot of thinking, is not a hassle subject. Even with a lot of readings and requirements and it making us have to think more critically and deeper, it ain't so hard at all. It's actually fun to learn. However, I wouldn't say that \"philo classes deprive me of childhood\" but if given the chance, I would like to return to the laidbackness of childhood and those days when I didn't know a thing about philosophy. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate philo. It's just that sometimes I miss my childhood because of the kind of carefree and laidback I faced then; and that I didn't do as much thinking as now.\n",

IM FUCKING TRYING OKAY???!?? and i know we all probably have a like 3-4 groupworks to work on / are currently working ang sad talaga how you cant help yet because you have to finish this other project with another group and after doing so there is another one... you kinda feel that whoever is last will feel offended or might think that nagpapabuhat ka lang when in reality sobrang lunod ka na. -only a freshie Submitted:  November 17, 2018 10:06:18 AM +08\n",

Ito ay dahil kahit na paulit-ulit na nating pinag-aaralan yan, kailangan pa rin nating isanay ang ating mga sarili sa paggamit nito nang tama na tipong magsisilbi siyang paraan para mas maintindihan ka ng mga ibang tao lalo na sa mga taong wala namang background sa English. \n",
      "2. Para sa akin kasi kailangan mo ipractice nang ipractice ang Filipino kasi kung matagal mo na siyang hindi nagagamit sa tingin mo ba yung galing mo sa pagsalita ng Filipino noon parehas pa rin ba siya pagkatapos ng matagal na panahon ng hindi mo paggamit nito? Parang math lang yan, hindi porket napag-aralan mo na siya noon, maalala mo na agad kung paano mo isolve ang isang problem after ng ilang yrs na hindi mo paggamit nito. [Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino. Siya na rin mismo nagsabi na nakalimutan na rin niya paano yung mga balarila sa Filipino. (May ganun talagang case believe it or not meng)]\n",
      " 3. Para kanino ba tayo? (Medyo pareho lang punto ko dito at sa 1) Hindi ba ito nakakalungkot? Para sa akin, kaya natin ito ginagawa kasi para makapagsilbi tayo sa mga taong wala namang oportunidad. Hindi ba kaya may wika kasi para mas magkaroon ng maayos na komunikasyon sa mga tao? Kung hindi naman mapapalalim ang kaalaman natin tungkol sa wika natin, paano tayo magiging matagumpay sa pagtulong ng mga taong nasa mga laylayan? Alam mo ba na may mga batas nga na para sa mga kasambahay, magsasaka, atbp. pero halos lahat naman ng mga taong kabilang sa dito, wala naman gaanong alam tungkol dito kasi naka-English yung batas natin. Hindi pa nila maintindihan. Yung layunin na makapagpaalam sa mga taong makikinabang sana sa mga ito, wala na agad dahil doon. So ayun, hindi ko alam kung napakita ko ba yung kahalagahan ng pag-aral nito kahit sa kolehiyo haha sana makuha kahit konti lang hindi ako magaling makipagdebate tungkol sa isyu na ito nakakatrigger ka lang (sinubukan ko rin maging purong Filipino yung sasabihin ko dito, pero kita mo naman di ba haha sana marealize mo yun hehe peace!)

      "Hi I saw this post about an app by an ateneo org regarding parking in ateneo. I find it very convenient to be able to help in finding parking but this gives more people a reason to bring a car. Now all of us who usually bring a car and live far away have to fight even worse for parking spots in the school. Moreover, actually having a means to enable lot reservation through whatever means may lead a chance to having other people’s cars stay longer just so that their friend or whoever they are messaging to be able to take the spot after them (hopefully people are better than this). I do strongly encourage not to add a lot reservation scheme because the parking will be full at all times especially at peak hours if many people will be using the app.  Anyways best of wishes on the app development.

I thought it was a couple fighting but gago that's so insane. Then this other girl starts chasing this guy out and he howls. It was so fucking weird. Then he was caught and brought outside of Gonzaga. I thought that was fucking wild bro, but then this girl stands on a table and it was an advertisement Marisol by TA. Then gago this dude goes back and snatches what the girl was holding. It was CRAZY so props to them, I haven't seen anything like it. I'm honestly just relieved too that it wasn't some random dude breaking in Ateneo.\n",

      "I hope that you get to read this. I am falling for you. How can I not? You have the most perfect face. You are f*king handsome. You are smart, You are responsible. You are funny. You are decent. You have so many girls crushing on you but you don't care about them. You are ambitious. You are everything good and I respect you. As your best friend, I am lucky to be the person you hug, you hold hands with, you send selfies to, you share food with, you wait for, you reserve a seat for, you offer your shoulder to sleep on... Sometimes, i wonder, do you like me? If so, are these the signals? Are you waiting for me to affirm this?  But i really don't know. Coz when we aren't in school, you rarely call or text. I know you said that you aren't ready for any relationship yet but you know, i can wait. But i wanna know if my wait is going to be worthwhile. When you told me not to leave you ever and I said yes, i really meant it. YOu said you were kilig and I wonder what that meant? Is this purely friendship? Coz you know i really like you and i wished that you would give me hints if you like me. Just so as you know, not all chinese girls have the great wall. If that's what is stopping you. And even if there was a great wall for me, I know that you are someone my parents will surely accept. I know i'm not the prettiest girl, i'm sure you have prettier ones waiting in line. I'm not the smartest either, you know that.  Am I too ambitious? Well, you know it's really hard to be pretending all the time.  When you hold my hand, i want to lock it in mine forever. When you hug me, i want to stay that way forever. When you say don't leave me, i wanted to tell you I will be here forever.... #ME freshie in love with bestfriend Submitted:  November 13, 2018 4:50:01 PM +08\n",

      "I don’t get the point of converting myself from an introvert to an extrovert. Like seriously, my father expects me to talk about something that makes my family feel entertained. It makes me feel like I am forced to come up with a presentation every time my family and I are seated together. Look, I am not like my brother at all who talks about anything. I understand the advantages of talking with people but I rather be alone so I can be in peace (I really hate noise). I tend to be social sometimes, especially when I’m with my friends, but I WILL NOT CHANGE MYSELF FROM BEING AN INTROVERT. No matter how many times you have been asking regarding my personality, don’t hope for a change, dad. It’s really disgusting and I really can’t do that because it’s unhealthy for me. Plus, I am not allowing myself to make the same mistake I had done to my (b*chy 🖕🏻) friend three years ago and it hurts for me to express things wrongly. 🎮🎮 Submitted:  November 11, 2018 10:33:02 PM +08\n",

      "I had this groupmate from SOM where when we had to think of a creative way to present a topic, SHE TRIED TO GOOGLE EVERY SINGLE THING. I mean gets, you can google the summary of the topic or something, but bitch was just GOOGLING EVERYTHING - even the tagline or motto or anything we had to put in the docs. The worst part was our group didn't know each other, and she was the most vocal one. So when we started suggesting things, and everyone was agreeing except her. She was just like, \"uhh i don't think that's a good idea *GOOGLES* i think this is a better idea! *shows vague article*\" and every time someone suggested something, she kept turning it down. That person knew she had little knowledge about the topic that's why she was googling, and people who were more informed about it were shelling out good ideas. But since people weren't close with each other and she was the most vocal one, she just turned down everyone's ideas by pointing out whats wrong with it and how those ideas were a \"hassle.\" Wala lang I'm from SOM also but sometimes, after 4 years in Ateneo, I still get amazed at how people in this school (JGSOM) lack sooooo much creativity. That there literally are people who try to rely on google for every single thing. I don't know if sigurista lang sila because they don't want to make mistakes, but seriously it wouldn't hurt to think outside the box sometimes. Submitted:  November 8, 2018 2:30:54 AM +08\n",

But the lack of connections I should've made while in Management, and the lack of technical skills and synthesis are killing me. A part of me wishes the previous metaphor to be, in fact, reality. There's no amount of salary or job security that will replace meaning. The worst part is I'm probably stuck here until I die. I hope I'm reborn into an interesting person next life.

      "I spent an entire year trying to get over the Great Wall. Just recently, I managed to get my guy to help me climb it. I regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context: I had been seeing this guy for almost an entire year. We told each other we were in love with the other, but for an entire year he refused to tell his parents about how he felt towards me. In a turn of events, he finally did.  His mother and father were a lot more bigoted than I thought. They threatened to stop paying for his education. They cried. They acted as if he was throwing his future away, and kept on insisting that even if I was \"a nice girl,\" my family was the one he should be wary of. His dad even mentioned that marrying a Filipina was a death sentence for any reasonable, successful businessman because no one wanted to do business with someone who had the audacity to marry what they generally think is an ugly gold digger.  I felt angry. Not only were they disrespecting me, they were disrespecting my family. My mom and dad hold masters degrees/PhDs and were academic and financial scholars respectively. They have made a respectable living out of their jobs and have even been expatriated in the past. His parents have no right to generalize that we're so money hungry and classless that I'd go for their eldest son in order to sustain us. It made me realize that all the agony and kasawian we go through in trying to \"climb the great wall\" is degrading and useless. If you respect yourself enough, don't grovel at their feet. Don't give them that power.  I love him, yes, but I love myself too. It took me a year to find that love and self-respect to just accept it's not going to happen. The best you can do is change this generation's mind about Filipino-Chinese relationships, but don't bet on it that you'll get your own happy ending in this one.

      "I have strict and overprotective parents to the point na they want to know my every move. I don't have a phone password and they even monitor my internet activities. I'm turning 20 na next year. I'm basically an adult who's capable of making decisions, but since I still live under their roof, I have no rights apparently. I don't know why they're like this to me. I have good grades naman and I'm not the type who'll be 'pariwara' or something like that. I'm not that stupid, and I really value my acads.  I came across this tweet and I relate so much to it. It's true what they say na 'strict parents raise the best liars.' I still manage to sneak out and party every now and then. I have a solid group of friends who always cover for me. They understand my situation and they want me to have some fun din naman. I noticed that the kids with stricter parents are the ones who become the wildest pa nga sa mga parties. They want to seize every opportunity they get to go out kasi so they end up getting wasted talaga or really promiscous.  Dear parents, you're not doing your kids a favor by being outright controlling. If you constantly invade their privacy, they're just going to rebel and resent you forever for it. It'll just strain your relationship with your child, and they wouldn't be comfortable talking about what's going on in their lives with you anymore. If you have concerns with them drinking or having sexual relations then talk to them about it. Go set boundaries and explain your concerns, but don't forget to listen to your child's side din. We're not little kids anymore, we know what's right and wrong. We can look after ourselves if only you let us. Submitted:  November 5, 2018 7:01:50 PM +08\n",

      "A few days ago, I was walking home from another late-night orientation. I was taking my usual route out of Ateneo — I'd exit from CTC then make my way through SOM forest until I arrived at the covered path to Gate 2.5. But once I reached the forest, I knew there was something wrong. The hair on my arms stood up as I surveyed the unnaturally dark surrounding. I noticed that it was too quiet, as if the whole forest was holding its breath. Despite this, I braved on, determined to get home. And anyways, it was just a short path. What was the worst that could happen, right? As I walked, the post about the Rendezvous Girl popped in my head. I shrugged the thoughts away — it was just another silly story for scaring people. Also, I'm a girl. I was sure that the offer of \"free head\" wouldn't apply to me.  In the distance, I could already see the lights from the covered pathway. With newfound courage (and a bit of smugness), I jokingly whispered \"Rendezvous\". As the word escaped my lips, a chill emitted from behind me. Every cell in my body was shouting for me to run, but I turned around anyway.  That's when I saw him. The first thing I noticed was the paper bag on his head. Up to now, the crudely drawn smiley is still branded in my memory. My eyes went down, trailing over his naked and grimy body, until they settled over a smaller paper bag, with a similar smiley, covering his nether region. In another situation, I would have found it funny, but at that moment, all I felt was fear.  He tilted his head to the side and curled his index finger two times, a summon for me to draw nearer. I can't explain it, but I took a step toward him. I was only 5 feet away when the lower paper bag fell off. A scream formed in the back of my throat as I saw the mangled and rotting remains of his phallus. A thick fetid gooey liquid was spurting out, and maggots were crawling through holes in the skin. I finally ran, the fastest that I've ever ran in my life, all the way to Gate 2.5, then all the way home.  But what happened in SOM forest stayed with me. Every night, I dream of Rendezvous Guy. Every night, he beckons me to come back. And every night, I feel myself slowly giving in. Submitted:  September 30, 2018 12:52:20 PM +08\n",

      "\n",
      "- Most of what's said about \"SJWs\" and the \"pa-woke\" actually present an extreme caricature and overwhelmingly do not represent anyone seeking a better society through organized social and political action. If anything, I generally see anyone bandying around comments like \"haha 3guarD sjw cuckés\" as someone unwilling to engage ideas head-on and get to the bottom of things. - Nobody is apolitical. Everything is political. Lines are drawn every time someone declares himself a \"neutral party\" to an issue. More often than not, neutrality is rooted in the belief that you have no stake in the issue, that it isn't important enough from your point of view to care. But for the labor-only contractual worker, the knife of unemployment, poverty, and hunger is constantly cold on his neck. It matters to him, and it matters to anyone who would dare demand a better world from powers-that-be. - Being 3dGy really doesn't cut it. It's not top-tier shitposting. It just exposes your prejudices. Submitted:  September 28, 2018 10:12:57 PM +08\n",

      "I think the reason why we really hate Filipino in college is not because of the language, but the topics in it. I’d understand if Filipino was about learning how to speak deeper Tagalog, learning like street tagalog culture, or anything related at our present times. \n",
      "Instead college Filipino (at least what i experienced here) for me had very unnecessary or lack of better term, useless topics. Lol So in Filipino, we learn about a girl falling in love with nature getting horny, we learn about the ancient Filipinos and their super weird cultures, and we are REQUIRED to memorize authors of books that we’ll probably never read again. What I’m trying to say is that these topics are not very applicable in our present society. Sure i can understand a girl loves nature, sure i can study about the ancient Filipino culture, sure i can memorize random authors names, BUT in the end, after I graduate, I’m sure all these things I learned will be forgotten simply because they’re useless. It’s not very applicable in life to talk about authors I memorized lol. I guess thats why people are against the Filipino subject. It’s not because Filipino sucks, it’s more because the topics being taught are really useless... Submitted:  November 23, 2018 10:33:48 AM +08\n",

      "I feel you guys. I’m an oldie of the org I assume you are referring to and to be honest I only remained a member because a) I still somehow love my work, and b) I still have very very good friends in the org. Yes they are VERY cliquish. What completely sucks is that there is a sense of “coldness” between the cast and the production teams. Hell cast members don’t even say hi to you when you say hi to them in the theater. For fuck’s sake one time, after I’d just finished doing the show for lights, I stepped out and they told me “Thank you for watching!” as of I were part of the audience. They didn’t even know I’d been there for literally almost every show. This was done to me 4 TIMES. 4 fucking times like holy shit di niyo ba ako kilala or something I try to say hi to you people every fucking time.  To all the people who defend the org and say “Just go to HR. They’re there for a reason,” this isn’t a simple “HR” problem. There’s a problem with how the org has been systematically. There is a lot of nepotism. Some people get positions that they don’t deserve but only get because they’re friends with the PMs. For example, I once applied to be the part of a mainstage second semester production. Prior to applying, I had done 3 org productions, 3 productions for another org, and I’d even done professional work outside of Ateneo. Basically, and not to boast, I was THE ONE for the job. I didn’t get it. Instead, someone who was close with the PM and whose only experience in Technicals was working in set & props got the job. It was incredibly frustrating.  That being said, to the two newbies who have spoken out, I implore you to stay not because of the people. Stay for the craft. It can’t be denied that said org still has great productions (despite a lot of backstage frustration) and the performers are still among the best in the school and even in the Philippines. Love your work. It doesn’t mean you have to love the people along the way. Screw them. Submitted:  November 23, 2018 7:19:00 AM +08\n",

      "I miss my S.O. back at home so bad... I've been restless for the past couple of weeks and I can't wait to go home. I've been super nervous and fidgety ever since she stopped replying to my messages often. I tell myself \"She's busy, she's studying, she's with her friends, you gotta give her some space man.\" But no matter how hard I try, that annoying thought lingers in my mind that she isn't interested in me anymore. I can't even tell her how I feel because she rarely ever replies. And yet, I tell myself \"She's busy with academics, give her space and it will all work out in the end...

      "\n",
      "THIS POST WAS MADE TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT NETWORKING AND HOW FRAUDULENT THEIR REPS ARE I know it's not good to generalize but there was this brand (rhymes with MuSkeen) who invited me for a meeting about a job opening in my field. Already skeptical about it, I told them that I'll think about it. Joke's on me for worrying to come off as impolite if I say no.  When the day came that he followed up for my confirmation, I straight up asked the person if it was a network marketing event. He literally said NO THAT IT WASNT. Believing him, I went to the meeting because I trusted him. THAT'S WHERE I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.  The speakers of the event were going on about how \"Network Marketing was the best way to earn money\" UGH FUQ IVE BEEN LIED TO AND I FELL FOR IT  I'm already laughing at myself for falling for this. But I'm sharing this experience to y'all AS A CAUTIONARY TALE to avoid people messaging you about a \"business venture\" or a \"business opportunity\", take everything with a grain of salt. If they won't tell you what brand they're working for, don't waste more time entertaining these shady people. If you already think they're dodgey, trust your gut. If you can't find them on the first page of Google, don't even think about it. Network marketers/pyramid scheme scammers make people on the higher wrungs richer. They're stigmatized for a reason. All these skincare/health pharma things may be the bread and butter to some but I hope these people DONT LIE TO PEOPLE JUST SO THEY CAN GET THEIR WAY. It's not impolite to step away when you realize it's a fraudulent invitation.  That's 2.5 hours of my life that I won't get back.

      "PUTTING THE SOSE THEORY TO THE TEST: Who is richer, the average SOH major or the average SOSE major? The SOSE supremacist would contend that SOH majors are rich and so could afford to be SOH majors where the average SOH job pays less than the average SOSE job. Emphasis on average: Do not go into tails! I mean average in the same way you cannot cross a river just because it is on average 3 feet deep. On the other hand, parents of lower net worth will be more inclined to sway their kids towards SOSE, not necessarily just out of highschool but from the very beginning of the kids' lives. Thus, the kids are not forced into SOSE. Rather, the kids are shown the wonders of math and science from their birth. SOH majors' parents are likely rich or SOH majors themselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "He markets it as a \"youth development\" program in barangays. Supposedly, he incubates projects in the barangay that can improve it. The catch? He asks for an insane amount of money (hundreds of thousands) from the LGU to run his \"program\" but how many of those projects actually come to life? Hmm... And where does all that money go? Hmm... He also sends people to the \"UN\" and asks for a crazy amount of money too. I heard the participants of his \"training program\" for this \"UN thing\" always have a ton of complaints because it's not run well.  Is this what Ateneo taught us? Is this \"development\" or is Scammy S just using people and barangays for money? Oh and Scammy S also likes to take credit for his team's work without doing any of the actual work. He just likes the photo ops in high level places so he looks cool. I think three full core teams have quit under him because of his lack of professionalism. Come on, Scammy S!  Ateneans, you have been warned! Don't fall for pretty marketing with no substance! Submitted:  November 22, 2018 7:15:39 AM +08\n",

      "Okay so here's an update from an FW post I submitted back in September (7394, for reference). Palapit na ang finals, and for some reason I am still so fuckin attracted to my classmate that I found super duper cute?? Like wth patapos na yung sem tapos wala naman nangyayari. Bobo lang ako. Now I just kinda hate him because wala tangina gusto ko pa rin siya huhu. I gave up on trying to be halaman altogether, but I also kinda gave up on him at some point kasi sobrang wala kaming common friend circles at common activities except that one class we have together. And I was super obvious with him and got the feel na sinusungitan niya ako ergo di siya interested. Tapos out of nowhere kinausap niya ako after class??!?! As in I know that's nbd pero isipin mo. Isipin mo yung sobrang crush na crush mo isang tao tapos sinungitan ka nila, tapos kumbinsado ka na ayaw na ayaw nila sayo tapos biglang kakausapin ka nila?? Naku kuya mahirap yan. I'm so Maropoque™. Kaya ayan naloka ako all over again. Tumingin ulit ako sa horoscope para lang may reference ako of some sort na kung type ba ng sign niya yung girl yung magmamake ng first move?? Honestly sobrang bobo ko lang. Like, am I really gonna base my actions on his natal chart? Tbh probably but sobrang ???  Apparently his sign will try anything once, so I was kinda banking on that?? But ayun, recently, I decided okay fine- I'll ask him out. Fuck it. I'm gonna do it. What's the worst that could happen? I've been rejected several times before. I can handle it.  And I started telling people na parang okay I'm gonna do it, kahit na sobrang mukhang cannot be, susubukan ko kasi I will never know for sure. After asking for some advice, I figured sige I can build up talking to him for a few times muna after class before really asking him out, kahit one meeting lang. So ayun hinahype ko sarili ko, kakausapin ko siya after class.  Ito na. Ito na. Tapos alam mo yung sa movies, yung hahabulin na ng main character yung gusto nila tapos biglang pag nag-pan na yung camera may kasamang iba AGOYYYYYY There was a girl waiting for him na, and they walked together. And like ang sakit mga pare bro. As in feel ko naman tropa lang sila pero alam mo yung sobrang naramdaman ko lang lalo na magka-ibang mundo kami and sobrang longshot talaga. And parang he has enough girls around him, and hindi kami same crowd, so di rin ako tugma sa personality ng mga girls that he usually hangs around.  But also for some reason parang this is the third time since freshman year na I've seen this same girl with a guy I like and parang ate girl tulong how?? Tapos ex ata siya ng orsem crush ko, so wow an extra oof. Oof lang talaga.  Submitted:  November 22, 2018 2:33:55 AM +08\n",

      "Everybody has a story behind that cigarette that they smoke. Some people smoke because they think its cool, some people smoke because its part of their routine, but the reason i smoke is because of a girl. A girl whom i love so much it hurts, the urge to see and talk to her is always there. The smile from her angelic face never fails to make me feel loved. But of course where there is light, there is darkness ; it hurts when you feel no comfort from anyone. When the love of your life is no longer yours you feel like nothing matters. She doesnt even care about what you do anymore, she hurt you like you were no one to her. Also Imagine getting betrayed by your friends when you treated them like family yeah that happened to me too. I would even die for them or even help them hide a dead body if they needed me to. Everything hurts to the point you’re numb and you don’t even know yourself anymore. Sometimes you just dont know eho to trust and lean on. That is where my cigarette comes in, it comforts me whenever i feel alone and unwanted. It just makes you forget about the problems that you have as if it comes with the smoke that you release from between your lips. So guys whenever you see a smoker just ask him/her about his/her life dont judge him or her right away because you never know the story behind that burnt cigarette.

      "How do you know if you have depression or if you're just thinking too much about things? As much as I'd like to feel better, I don't want to see a doctor/therapist/counselor just to find out I'm overstating my problems. Lately I've just been feeling generally down and that there isn't any point to anything. In the end, we all just die, and trying to \"find meaning\" in things just feels like hedonism to me. Sure, I can be happy and enjoy myself at times, but I don't know if that's just a distraction from how empty I feel. I feel that I can't relate with anyone. Why does it seem like everyone in Ateneo has so many friends and good relationships with other people, while I am just superficially connected to everyone? There are many of the little projects like JSEC challenge/SOM event case studies that need groups but I've never been able to be part of those because it just seems I'm not close enough to anyone to be invited to a group. I don't want burden people with my feelings, and I'd rather listen to other people and help them out, but no one tells me anything. I don't know how my blockmates can talk to each other so casually and, y'know, connect, when any conversation I start gets killed because it seems no one wants to talk to me.  It's like no one wants to know me. Maybe I'm just thinking too much. Everybody knows me as the super extroverted guy that isn't afraid to do anything, the guy with all the jokes and with the boundless energy and a mystic energy source that makes him always feel good. Heck, I even was a TNT back at OrSem.  I guarantee anyone who knows my name and has met me more than a couple of times will be surprised if they find out I wrote this. guess we all just have problems Submitted:  November 21, 2018 11:38:17 AM +08\n",

      "I'm glad that the typical anakbayan types of groups are focusing more on this nowadays rather than U.S intervention thousands of kilometers away. Don't get me wrong, it's important too as things like Iraq were wrong, but I'm pretty sure a country which aims to say that an entire SEA is their exclusive property, including areas only 50 miles away from Palawan, is more important.  Sure, these types of people post US-China-Duterte triumvirate regime posters/graffiti thinking that Xi Jinping is secretly teamed up with Trump or some other flat Earth tier belief but atleast they're finally focusing more on this joke of a map.  Seriously, everyone should. Like this is straight up imperialism, and it's not happening in some other continent, it's happening a few dozen miles away from Palawan. This is not okay. P.S: 1 million Uyghur muslim natives are being put in \"re-education\" camps by the Chinese government right now, with some being tortured...and we're getting closer politically and now physically to this country.

While this is obviously the likely outcome since they were the most affected, the proof that Ateneans generally agree with the results is a strong statement in itself. Second, I rewatched the video of PUP and it was really amazing. No doubt that UP also had an amazing presentation, but PUP's plans was really focused and targeted. PUP vs the Ateneo's and UP's showed amazing art vs just showing science. While marketing is heavily dependent on science, at the end of the day science will only bring you so far, it is art that changes the game. I am 100% sure that PUP's art is the real deal. Third, it seems super fishy that the post was super focused and looked like it was written by someone heavily involved in the competition. As an Atenean SOM student who is active in competitions and has a lot of friends in competitions, I can be sure when I say that Ateneans are not as involved unless the ones competing or contributing. This post was probably written by someone really invested or had friends that were really invested. Going back to the first point it seems like the Ateneans really involved here have denied the allegations.  Fourth, the judges are all credible and are huge in the marketing organization. This does not mean they are not prone to fraud, but it also means that they have no gain already and most of them aren't doing this for money but they really believe in the future of marketing. In summary, I'm not saying that the post is false. That's the beauty and ugly of anonymity. We can never be too sure. However, given the points above, it is unfair to PUP that there are lots of bashers. We need to give credit where it is due. PUP was great. Whether you believed they were the best or not is your opinion. For the sets of judges, and for a lot of other students, PUP was the clear winner.  Submitted:  November 20, 2018 10:42:56 PM +08\n",

      "i can't help but feel bad for couples who have the \"above/under\" type of dynamic wherein either one of them is very strong in terms of personality, while the other leans toward the more passive side. inevitably, there will always be someone who is dominant/ submissive in a relationship, but what gets really scary is when for example, the girl (or the boy of course) gets EXTREMELY  controlling of her partner to the point where the partner is all but a  small little dog that follows her around, gets too scared when she gets mad, and gets anxiety attacks whenever he thinks he did something wrong. it gets really sad because even if you want to tell them that there is something wrong with the dynamic, you can't help but realize that the \"under\" does it out of love. At what point do we draw the line between saying that it is okay to do it out of love, and saying that the girl, is simply too toxic for the boy and simply abuses his kindness?   again, this can conversely happen the other way around wherein the male is the more dominant figure and that the female gets treated and taken advantage of simply because she was kind.  hoping for some great feedback!

      "I am very disappointed with whoever is handling this year’s ID party finances. For one, sobrang supot ng party. But that’s not where this is coming from entirely. When I first saw the ID seniors posting about their deck of cards I thought na ang mahal niya. 650 for a deck of cards? Pero sige pagbigyan kasi nga naman diba support artists. Only to find out when I asked a friend kung nakakakuha ba sila ng comission ay aba, wala. 650 and none of the artists gets anything. Funds daw para sa party. Seems a bit unethical. Even worse is nakita ko yung quality ng cards kasi may kaibigan akong bumili... sana ako na lang pumrint. Hindi po ganoon ka mahal magprint ng ganung quality. Ibig sabihin sobrang laki ng patong sa cards, hindi pumupunta sa artists, at pumunta sa napakasupot na party. Very disappointing ID seniors, but the ones who are managing the finances especially. May transparency ba between you and your batchmates or napupunta lang ba lahat ng pera sa mga bulsa niyo? -a graduate Submitted:  November 20, 2018 1:38:22 PM +08\n",

      " tbh, it’s so evident that it’s just you guys who gives this big of a shit for this whole thing? like damn, chill out. get over it.  Why can’t we just be happy for a school that doesn’t win so often? Personally, the PUP win was expected. Yes, the judges’ comments were off at times, and yes UP’s presentation was no doubt some great shit… but PUP’s was overall the most realistic and doable campaign. Offhand, UP’s campaign seemed like a tourism campaign that just inserted sustainability. PUP’s campaign effectively highlighted the sustainability aspect. YES, the jingle was their strong point.. but really, realistically, a jingle goes a long way especially with their target market. I see how the judges could really lean towards their campaign.  “If we lose to a fucking jingle, tangina lang.” - UP PANA team member heard outside Irwin.  Please stop being such obnoxious and entitled people with this. When the PUP team won, the least you could have done was to try to be happy for them. Crying on stage and making a scene at the side or Irwin after the awarding was just so tasteless. It reflects so much on how entitled you are. We get that you always win. Sadly, it seems to have gotten to your head. Para kayong mga bata eh, mga iyakin.  It was not in losing to PUP that you lost your pride. It was in how you reacted when you got second place. With the way you acted, and are acting to invalidate their win, you are a disgrace to the marketing community. Nakakahiya kayo and it’s disgusting. In this case, you are definitely not deserving of winning.  Please get off your high horse, get your heads out of your asses, and get off of our freedom wall. Stop using ADMU’s platform for your dirty shit.  SIT DOWN. BE HUMBLE.  If you can’t take losing, then don’t join the competition.

She even told them how bonfires were illegal and they should have done their homework to know that it's illegal. Pero when PUP recommended Laboracay 2.0, which again, was already illegal, she just laughed it off and gave a sarcastic comment. If that isn't bias then idk what is. I hope the other people who were there speak up as well. If PUP believes that they deserve that award, they should be willing to have PANA post all the videos.

I never said produced shit output. If you go back to my post you'd see I actually commended them and their campaign. I'm attacking the mechanism and the \"system\" that runs in that organization. Para matapos na lahat, I just want PANA to post the criteria, the videos of all the presentations, and the breakdown of scores. I'm sure everyone would appreciate that. If PUP is certain that they check off all the criteria then what's there to fear? I understand the fact that the scoring may be objective to some extent but for things that you can clearly quantify, like say specific marketing technicalities, dun talaga magkakatalo. Both teams presented great campaigns, it's just that as for marketing technicalities, the other really stood out clearly. A video including the Q&A would be great too. That's where you'll see how the judges didn't grill PUP at all when there were lots of things that can possibly be questioned vs all the rest of the teams, not just UP. Everyone else was grilled for the algorithms of their apps/sites etc, for the sustainability aspect. Accountability and transparency, PANA. That wouldn't be difficult to give if everything was well-deserved. I hope all PANA teams encourage this for the sake of transparency. :) Submitted:  November 20, 2018 1:16:06 AM +08\n",

      "You may not actually be able to do anything yourself but try to keep a close watch on the person if there is a sudden change on him. Try not to give any special treatment to the person because most of them do not want to look pity on but rather treat the person how you normally treat them. The final move is always on the person but you people may give him the comfort of belonging. You could also search some signs because most of the time you will see it if you observe.

      "Why do people get mad at the fact that basketball is the most popular sport in the country? They mention how we should just focus on sports like billiards and football or some other height appropriate game. They say that basketball programs should be defunded and that we should literally just play for the medals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reality. You aren't going to convince any young basketball player to play football by defunding basketball programs. These people play basketball because it's an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because it's what they want, it's what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids aren't playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country won't produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldn't even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but I'd rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they don't give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball won't turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you can't convince a person who loves Kyrie Irving's insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal. A gold medal which he doesn't give a shit about, a medal only there so that Filipinos can brag about being Filipinos. Submitted:  November 19, 2018 11:53:02 PM +08\n",

      "I just wanted to let you know how happy I was to walk with you that night. Just the two of us under the night sky and the cold air. I was so happy that we finally got to have a real conversation, since we only meet in one class. Even if it was only brief, I will treasure that moment for a long time. Everyday, I try to prepare something to talk about, but I never had the courage to actually talk to you. I am so sorry. I may look so calm from the outside, but there's a constant war inside of me all the time. My heart keeps telling me to talk to you, but my body won't let me. I cry everyday out of frustration. I hate myself for being so shy. I think: \"Why can't I talk like a normal person??\".  I think, if I wasn't just so shy, we could be closer by now. We're always working together, yet I still feel so awkward.  *sigh*.  The sem is almost over and I'm afraid that we might never see each other anymore. But one's thing for sure, I will never forget your beautiful smile that never fails to  brighten up my day. And you're so cute with the way you constantly fix your hair. But most importantly your voice. The moment I hear it, everything just feels right. I'm just scared of what might happen in the future. I just feel so happy imagining a future with you. I just don't know if a guy like you could actually like a guy like me.  Submitted:  November 19, 2018 11:51:54 PM +08\n",

When I stopped taking a photo I found myself staring at how your eyes were watching everything in tired, forced wonder. Trying so hard to make this moment beautiful. I felt your hand in mine. I felt the squeeze and the slight turn to see if I got flustered enough to glow like the lights against the pitch black Makati night. You smiled tiredly, as if you wanted to wake up to see me once more when your mind is in better states. You mouthed an \"I love you\" even before mine could tumble out of my lips.

I was worried, you know? For the better part of the day you weren't your normal, cheery/sleepy/sabog/excitable self - you were more like me: quiet, sober, and looked depressed. I would have asked if you were ok, but i'm shy and didn't want to disturb you.  I just want to say, that even though you fucked up, it will be fine; in a few days, no one will remember that incident, and you can move on. So chin up! the day moves on. And if ever you're feeling down and/or want to talk, I'm always just a short message away. Cheers!\n",

      "If you're fat, and you sweat a lot. Please, please. Take a bath religiously, at least twice a day. AND DON'T TAKE A BATH FOR 5 MINUTES LANG. Please. Scrub. Exfoliate. Use rexona. My roommate is fat. The thing is he doesn't take a bath every day. Ang taba taba niya, tapus hindi pa siya naliligo. His course needs him to be physically active tapus ganyan siya. Sobrang what the fuck. I think meron naman siyang mga friends. Pwede ba?  Kung totoong kaibigan niya kayo, pwede bang sabihin ninyong mabaho siya. Na nakakadiri siyang tao.  Pag dumadating siya sa room namin after class, naghuhubad siya tapus sinasampay niya yung damit niya sa fan. Putangina napaka baho tuloy sa room namin putang ina. Kadiri. Alam ninyo yung amoy ng sukang hinaluan ng mang tomas, ganun. And don't even get me started on the smell of his shoes. Myghad!  I have friends who only take a bath every 3 days or so. Pero puta they don't smell like this. Kadiri talaga yung mga chubs. Especially yung mga walang hygiene.  Iw.  And please don't let your clothes just be there in the open. Put it on a SEALED container. Nobody wants to smell your shit, you fat fuck.  Grabe. Good luck on your new roommate, I'm out.  Submitted:  November 19, 2018 12:55:13 AM +08\n",

      "In 1987, the Yatabe Test Circuit was the place to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many different tuners testing their luck out there, and so the place was filled with race-tuned JDM legends ready to take a shot at hitting 200mph/320kph. Most of the cars being tested on the circuit back then were Nissan creations, specifically those from the Z lineup and the Skyline lineup. To see a car from another manufacturer was a little unheard of then. So when the RE Amemiya team came to the circuit one day, it was a move that few expected. But what happened that day is something that only the team had really anticipated for. In 1987, RE Amemiya became legend for setting one of the fastest time records that Yatabe has ever seen. But how? It was with the FORTIS RX-7 that magic happened. Using a combination of 13 years of Rotary engine tuning experience and carefully crafted parts (a majority of which were created by RE Amemiya themselves) the car had its power output increased to 440PS. And so it was on that fateful day that the fast yet stable FORTIS RX-7 was able to hit a top speed of 315.1km/h, a record in Yatabe for both rotary and non-rotary cars alike. Extremely proud of the results, RE-Amemiya participated in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon, where the car won a grand prize in the auto salon's tuned car division.\n",
      " Because of the FORTIS RX-7's success on both the track and the show, RE Amemiya decided to revamp her for the following year, strengthening her in both aspects. 1988 turned out to be both a good year and a bad year for the car, as though the FORTIS RX-7 failed to set any new records in \n",
      " Yatabe, the car won the Tudor Card Excellence Award in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon.  It was in 1988 where the trail ended though.  The last records that I could find for the car was from that year, and then the following year in 1989, the trail goes cold. Nobody knows the whereabouts of the car, and even those who were possibly actively searching then most likely came up empty-handed. In fact, aside from a single page that showcases the car's spec list and its achievements, RE Amemiya seems to have mostly forgotten about the car, especially in light with their later tuning achievements like the Super GT GT300 RX7. If it weren't for a certain Japanese Tuner Magazine's video, I probably wouldn't have even knew that this ever existed!  But here it is. I don't know how I found it, but I sure am glad I am to be able to share this forgotten piece of history with you guys. Just looking at the pics made me realize that the car would still look dope even today. Enjoy!  Submitted:  November 19, 2018 12:21:19 AM +08\n",

      "This is my opinion but I think that an underlying problem with ADMU is that it discourages its students from walking around, given how certain important buildings like Bellarmine Hall and ISO are located FAR AWAY from where most of the Loyola School (LS) buildings are clustered. Meanwhile the really niche buildings like PIPAC, the freshman dorm halls (Cervini/Eliazo), and even the ASOG are located closer to LS. It's why students complain a lot about their BEL-CTC scheds and you can't blame them since they were probably batch 2 and were forced to pick those BEL classes next to their CTC classes. In any case, it still doesn't take away my point that the way ADMU has been planned has been quite crap. Instead of devoting so much money on creating more and maintaining existing parking spaces and encouraging students to bring their cars, they should've just focus on relocating the important buildings like cafeterias and BEL/FA ANNEX buildings closer to the LS area. This would've perhaps lead students to rely less on their cars, which will eventually reduce the need for parking spaces, and use those other remaining spaces as ports for trikes and other public transpo. That way, that remaining space will take up even less space compared to the already existing parking spaces. Even so, it would also help create more space for more trees = more shade = relatively cooler campus. At the very least I do hope they could at least make their existing buildings more \"green\" (though I'm not saying that in a Lasallian way). I mean, allowing vertical gardens to be a thing in the existing building clusters like Leong Hall, Rizal Libs, Soc Sci, De La Costa, etc.  Regardless, what Ateneo should be doing is making its campus even more pedestrian friendly, since in all honesty, it's one of the best campuses to stroll around.  Thus, making it more \"walkable\" will perhaps help ease out the traffic outside Katipunan. #UrbanPlanningADMU  Submitted:  November 18, 2018 5:42:52 PM +08\n",

      "How does it feel that you have been working hard to help somebody but he/she does not appreciate for what you have done? Well I have been feeling like that kanina while I was being used for printing and cutting out business cards. It was around 10am when my brother asked me to print out 17 sheets of business cards (9 per sheet) on a short bond paper ole he was at a bazaar. So I printed 10 sheets on a wrong paper since it was too thin. Then, I printed another 17 on another paper that’s somewhat thicker, spent my time cutting then according to those outlines of the cards, and arranging in an orderly manner. (Of course I didn’t cut them all yet since I also had to work on my deliverable for my major) When he arrived home, he saw that I was cutting and stacking them. He was glad until my mom pointed out that the paper I used was too thin for a business card. I’m a college undergrad and I don’t have an internship yet so don’t expect me to find a specific kind of paper for that. Another is that he didn’t mention what kind of short bond paper he wanted me to use (carboard paper) so I have nothing to be ashamed of. Seriously, galit na ako ah and I have other things to do other than your pathetic business cards. I was really planning to do a report and my project deliverable on the same day. I’m tired na and I don’t want to cram UGH. If you would have told me the night before, I would set my time to do it. But now, it’s like I don’t want to help you anymore. I’m not being used as a business slave. 😡😡 Submitted:  November 18, 2018 12:28:59 AM +08\n",

      "Personally, I think that philosophy, even if it requires a lot of thinking, is not a hassle subject. Even with a lot of readings and requirements and it making us have to think more critically and deeper, it ain't so hard at all. It's actually fun to learn. However, I wouldn't say that \"philo classes deprive me of childhood\" but if given the chance, I would like to return to the laidbackness of childhood and those days when I didn't know a thing about philosophy. Don't get me wrong. I don't hate philo. It's just that sometimes I miss my childhood because of the kind of carefree and laidback I faced then; and that I didn't do as much thinking as now.\n",

[Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino. Siya na rin mismo nagsabi na nakalimutan na rin niya paano yung mga balarila sa Filipino. (May ganun talagang case believe it or not meng)]\n",
      " 3. Para kanino ba tayo? (Medyo pareho lang punto ko dito at sa 1) Hindi ba ito nakakalungkot? Para sa akin, kaya natin ito ginagawa kasi para makapagsilbi tayo sa mga taong wala namang oportunidad. Hindi ba kaya may wika kasi para mas magkaroon ng maayos na komunikasyon sa mga tao? Kung hindi naman mapapalalim ang kaalaman natin tungkol sa wika natin, paano tayo magiging matagumpay sa pagtulong ng mga taong nasa mga laylayan? Alam mo ba na may mga batas nga na para sa mga kasambahay, magsasaka, atbp. pero halos lahat naman ng mga taong kabilang sa dito, wala naman gaanong alam tungkol dito kasi naka-English yung batas natin. Hindi pa nila maintindihan. Yung layunin na makapagpaalam sa mga taong makikinabang sana sa mga ito, wala na agad dahil doon. So ayun, hindi ko alam kung napakita ko ba yung kahalagahan ng pag-aral nito kahit sa kolehiyo haha sana makuha kahit konti lang hindi ako magaling makipagdebate tungkol sa isyu na ito nakakatrigger ka lang (sinubukan ko rin maging purong Filipino yung sasabihin ko dito, pero kita mo naman di ba haha sana marealize mo yun hehe peace!)

      "Hi I saw this post about an app by an ateneo org regarding parking in ateneo. I find it very convenient to be able to help in finding parking but this gives more people a reason to bring a car. Now all of us who usually bring a car and live far away have to fight even worse for parking spots in the school. Moreover, actually having a means to enable lot reservation through whatever means may lead a chance to having other people’s cars stay longer just so that their friend or whoever they are messaging to be able to take the spot after them (hopefully people are better than this). I do strongly encourage not to add a lot reservation scheme because the parking will be full at all times especially at peak hours if many people will be using the app.  Anyways best of wishes on the app development.

You are decent. You have so many girls crushing on you but you don't care about them. You are ambitious. You are everything good and I respect you. As your best friend, I am lucky to be the person you hug, you hold hands with, you send selfies to, you share food with, you wait for, you reserve a seat for, you offer your shoulder to sleep on... Sometimes, i wonder, do you like me? If so, are these the signals? Are you waiting for me to affirm this?  But i really don't know. Coz when we aren't in school, you rarely call or text. I know you said that you aren't ready for any relationship yet but you know, i can wait. But i wanna know if my wait is going to be worthwhile. When you told me not to leave you ever and I said yes, i really meant it. YOu said you were kilig and I wonder what that meant? Is this purely friendship? Coz you know i really like you and i wished that you would give me hints if you like me. Just so as you know, not all chinese girls have the great wall. If that's what is stopping you. And even if there was a great wall for me, I know that you are someone my parents will surely accept. I know i'm not the prettiest girl, i'm sure you have prettier ones waiting in line. I'm not the smartest either, you know that.  Am I too ambitious? Well, you know it's really hard to be pretending all the time.  When you hold my hand, i want to lock it in mine forever. When you hug me, i want to stay that way forever. When you say don't leave me, i wanted to tell you I will be here forever.... #ME freshie in love with bestfriend Submitted:  November 13, 2018 4:50:01 PM +08\n",

      "I don’t get the point of converting myself from an introvert to an extrovert. Like seriously, my father expects me to talk about something that makes my family feel entertained. It makes me feel like I am forced to come up with a presentation every time my family and I are seated together. Look, I am not like my brother at all who talks about anything. I understand the advantages of talking with people but I rather be alone so I can be in peace (I really hate noise). I tend to be social sometimes, especially when I’m with my friends, but I WILL NOT CHANGE MYSELF FROM BEING AN INTROVERT. No matter how many times you have been asking regarding my personality, don’t hope for a change, dad. It’s really disgusting and I really can’t do that because it’s unhealthy for me. Plus, I am not allowing myself to make the same mistake I had done to my (b*chy 🖕🏻) friend three years ago and it hurts for me to express things wrongly. 🎮🎮 Submitted:  November 11, 2018 10:33:02 PM +08\n",

      "I had this groupmate from SOM where when we had to think of a creative way to present a topic, SHE TRIED TO GOOGLE EVERY SINGLE THING. I mean gets, you can google the summary of the topic or something, but bitch was just GOOGLING EVERYTHING - even the tagline or motto or anything we had to put in the docs. The worst part was our group didn't know each other, and she was the most vocal one. So when we started suggesting things, and everyone was agreeing except her. She was just like, \"uhh i don't think that's a good idea *GOOGLES* i think this is a better idea! *shows vague article*\" and every time someone suggested something, she kept turning it down. That person knew she had little knowledge about the topic that's why she was googling, and people who were more informed about it were shelling out good ideas. But since people weren't close with each other and she was the most vocal one, she just turned down everyone's ideas by pointing out whats wrong with it and how those ideas were a \"hassle.\" Wala lang I'm from SOM also but sometimes, after 4 years in Ateneo, I still get amazed at how people in this school (JGSOM) lack sooooo much creativity. That there literally are people who try to rely on google for every single thing. I don't know if sigurista lang sila because they don't want to make mistakes, but seriously it wouldn't hurt to think outside the box sometimes. Submitted:  November 8, 2018 2:30:54 AM +08\n",

      "I spent an entire year trying to get over the Great Wall. Just recently, I managed to get my guy to help me climb it. I regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context: I had been seeing this guy for almost an entire year. We told each other we were in love with the other, but for an entire year he refused to tell his parents about how he felt towards me. In a turn of events, he finally did.  His mother and father were a lot more bigoted than I thought. They threatened to stop paying for his education. They cried. They acted as if he was throwing his future away, and kept on insisting that even if I was \"a nice girl,\" my family was the one he should be wary of. His dad even mentioned that marrying a Filipina was a death sentence for any reasonable, successful businessman because no one wanted to do business with someone who had the audacity to marry what they generally think is an ugly gold digger.  I felt angry. Not only were they disrespecting me, they were disrespecting my family. My mom and dad hold masters degrees/PhDs and were academic and financial scholars respectively. They have made a respectable living out of their jobs and have even been expatriated in the past. His parents have no right to generalize that we're so money hungry and classless that I'd go for their eldest son in order to sustain us. It made me realize that all the agony and kasawian we go through in trying to \"climb the great wall\" is degrading and useless. If you respect yourself enough, don't grovel at their feet. Don't give them that power.  I love him, yes, but I love myself too. It took me a year to find that love and self-respect to just accept it's not going to happen. The best you can do is change this generation's mind about Filipino-Chinese relationships, but don't bet on it that you'll get your own happy ending in this one.

      "I have strict and overprotective parents to the point na they want to know my every move. I don't have a phone password and they even monitor my internet activities. I'm turning 20 na next year. I'm basically an adult who's capable of making decisions, but since I still live under their roof, I have no rights apparently. I don't know why they're like this to me. I have good grades naman and I'm not the type who'll be 'pariwara' or something like that. I'm not that stupid, and I really value my acads.  I came across this tweet and I relate so much to it. It's true what they say na 'strict parents raise the best liars.' I still manage to sneak out and party every now and then. I have a solid group of friends who always cover for me. They understand my situation and they want me to have some fun din naman. I noticed that the kids with stricter parents are the ones who become the wildest pa nga sa mga parties. They want to seize every opportunity they get to go out kasi so they end up getting wasted talaga or really promiscous.  Dear parents, you're not doing your kids a favor by being outright controlling. If you constantly invade their privacy, they're just going to rebel and resent you forever for it. It'll just strain your relationship with your child, and they wouldn't be comfortable talking about what's going on in their lives with you anymore. If you have concerns with them drinking or having sexual relations then talk to them about it. Go set boundaries and explain your concerns, but don't forget to listen to your child's side din. We're not little kids anymore, we know what's right and wrong. We can look after ourselves if only you let us. Submitted:  November 5, 2018 7:01:50 PM +08\n",

But what I should’ve said was that no, i’m not rich, my parents are, and that’s why i’m here. I am aware that their money is not mine, and that i have to work hard to earn a living cause i don’t want to live off their money po i’m a strong independent woman siz\n",

      "More important?  I've been in your place, and even though it's not the exact same experience, I have an understanding of what it feels like to want to commit suicide. I get it; it's your life. Who am I to dictate your happiness? But your death will at least affect that person telling you not to die. Sure, you can argue that it's selfish of them to want you to live. The concept of wants and motivations are technically selfish. But the grief they would feel towards your death isn't genuine because it's selfish for them to not want to experience that? Bullshit. Aren't you the one being truly selfish for dismissing their feelings? Off yourself if you really want. It's ultimately your choice. But know that even if you were to die and it would be cause for grief, at least I would not blame you for following through with it because I acknowledge your feelings. I'm not going to (and I can't) force you to live, but at the very least acknowledge the feelings of those around you who don't want you to die too. Submitted:  November 3, 2018 4:05:13 AM +08\n",

      "A few days ago, I was walking home from another late-night orientation. I was taking my usual route out of Ateneo — I'd exit from CTC then make my way through SOM forest until I arrived at the covered path to Gate 2.5. But once I reached the forest, I knew there was something wrong. The hair on my arms stood up as I surveyed the unnaturally dark surrounding. I noticed that it was too quiet, as if the whole forest was holding its breath. Despite this, I braved on, determined to get home. And anyways, it was just a short path. What was the worst that could happen, right? As I walked, the post about the Rendezvous Girl popped in my head. I shrugged the thoughts away — it was just another silly story for scaring people. Also, I'm a girl. I was sure that the offer of \"free head\" wouldn't apply to me.  In the distance, I could already see the lights from the covered pathway. With newfound courage (and a bit of smugness), I jokingly whispered \"Rendezvous\". As the word escaped my lips, a chill emitted from behind me. Every cell in my body was shouting for me to run, but I turned around anyway.  That's when I saw him. The first thing I noticed was the paper bag on his head. Up to now, the crudely drawn smiley is still branded in my memory. My eyes went down, trailing over his naked and grimy body, until they settled over a smaller paper bag, with a similar smiley, covering his nether region. In another situation, I would have found it funny, but at that moment, all I felt was fear.  He tilted his head to the side and curled his index finger two times, a summon for me to draw nearer. I can't explain it, but I took a step toward him. I was only 5 feet away when the lower paper bag fell off. A scream formed in the back of my throat as I saw the mangled and rotting remains of his phallus. A thick fetid gooey liquid was spurting out, and maggots were crawling through holes in the skin. I finally ran, the fastest that I've ever ran in my life, all the way to Gate 2.5, then all the way home.  But what happened in SOM forest stayed with me. Every night, I dream of Rendezvous Guy. Every night, he beckons me to come back. And every night, I feel myself slowly giving in. Submitted:  September 30, 2018 12:52:20 PM +08\n",

      "I broke down so hard core at school today. Borderline suicidal already and stuff but what really encouraged me and made me smile despite the pain was when I got on the phone with my sister in the CR in SEC B then I guess the Ate overheard my conversation.

Life is tough even for the toughest, most indestructible cookie (like I thought I was) but giving love, even to people you don't know, is important. ALSO notice the Ates at school, even those who aren't Ate Alma. They're people, too, and they deserve to be loved as much as we do. So even if I'd really rather die than continue living with my mom, I thank God for showing me His Love even in the most unexpected place.

      "\n",
      "- Most of what's said about \"SJWs\" and the \"pa-woke\" actually present an extreme caricature and overwhelmingly do not represent anyone seeking a better society through organized social and political action. If anything, I generally see anyone bandying around comments like \"haha 3guarD sjw cuckés\" as someone unwilling to engage ideas head-on and get to the bottom of things. - Nobody is apolitical. Everything is political. Lines are drawn every time someone declares himself a \"neutral party\" to an issue. More often than not, neutrality is rooted in the belief that you have no stake in the issue, that it isn't important enough from your point of view to care. But for the labor-only contractual worker, the knife of unemployment, poverty, and hunger is constantly cold on his neck. It matters to him, and it matters to anyone who would dare demand a better world from powers-that-be. - Being 3dGy really doesn't cut it. It's not top-tier shitposting. It just exposes your prejudices. Submitted:  September 28, 2018 10:12:57 PM +08\n",

      "I think the LGBTQ+ community is creating too many terms too fast. I don't want to be misunderstood but here ah. I get that you want to express yourself fully, that not every word used and their meanings can fully describe the complexity of your sexualities and genders but the charge to come up with more words shouldn't be a charge. It should be a slower, methodical, and well thought out process of naming.  You're running the risk of literally alienating everyone that's trying to understand. It's starting to sound like a foreign language and what's worse is the language doesn't seem to stop changing. All the new terms being added is putting me off trying to understand. I'm not saying that I'm not trying, I really am but the problem is that it isn't centralized. It's a select few members of the community that's putting in new words when others have words for it already. You can see it right? Even members of the community are getting confused already.  It's beautiful that you can express yourself! But my goodness it has to slow down and reorganize or else it'll just alienate people.  Submitted:  September 28, 2018 6:16:14 AM +08\n",

      "It's okay to not to fit in with your block. Blocks aren't for everyone. One day in the not-so-distant future, you'll find out that some (if not most) of your blockmates were only pretending to be friends with each other just to fit in, and you'll realize that freshman year was just the FC phase. \n",
      "Once you outgrow the bulk of your block-section classes, you'll meet new friends in other classes. Take it from me. I met some of my closest friends from the most random classes. (Orgs too, of course, but if that's not your thing, don't feel pressured to join!)\n",
      " Bottomline is: Don't feel the need to fit in with your block. Try to make friends outside of your block, even if that just means coursemates. And most of all, you don't have to pretend to be someone you're not! You're great the way you are, and you'll find the right people in due time. \n",

      "1st, the people on strike aren't Nutriasia employees. They're B-Mirk Enterprise employees, they go to Nutriasia as outsourced workers (Like a call center agent doing work for a client, but is signed under the call center, not the client). Getting mad at Nutriasia is like getting mad at the call center's client because the client refuses to (and tbh, they shouldn't) give the call center employees benefits that they aren't entitled to anyway. Since you know... the workers are not the client's employees, they're the call center's... It's B-Mirk's job to ensure that the employees are enjoying benefits from them and are paid well, not Nutriasia. 2nd, the police were the one who beat them up, not Nutriasia.  So why is the hate targeted towards Nutriasia when it should be towards B-Mirk Enterprise and the police? The only sin of Nutriasia here is picking a bad labor provider, nothing more really.

I've overextended my stay at college, lost friends from a big slip from my vulnerable ass, and disappointed my family by failing a class for the 3rd time. It's like the more I fight, the more willpower I lose. Every time I try it all just blows up in my face. I genuinely think I just destroy everything I touch and keep lying about it to keep being likable. Now I'm gonna have to go through these next 2 years or so alone because all my friends have graduated and won't talk to me, and heaven knows I'm a brick wall when it comes to socializing and meeting new people. Not to mention I'm far from husband material with my exponentially extending list of failures. Hahaha. And here I am feeling sorry for myself on a Facebook group instead of trying to fix things.

Everyone tells me I'm nice and friendly and loving, but why? To be honest, I tried to cheat too, just to feel what it's like. I wanted to know why he did it over and over again. I was miserable. Emailing those who are looking for fubus or fwbs or momol buddies and the like. I felt guilty everytime I typed a message, and I eventually don't reply when they send their reply.  I still love him, and I'm stupid for that. I don't have the heart to break up with him, and I just end up crying to myself. Because I know that the I love you's we exchanged were half meant, because only I meant it.  And if can anyone answer my question above, please do. I'd love to hear others' opinions about this.

And when I say cute, kasama na rin height hahahaha. The worst part actually is, I detest Physics. I mean, I do have a history of getting the merits and distinctions in Physics in my previous schools, but I just can't get myself to, at least, even like the subject. Something about parabola, free-fall, quantum mechanics and mathematical equations. I guess hahaha.

The tweet that became popular said that Ateneo was just a 2nd rate University compared to U.P. https://mobile.twitter.com/piodu…/status/1044147879479111680 I know it's a joke tweet but it reminded  me of that age old discussion of University rankings. In the end, the general rank of your University is a far less important than the rank of your specific course. A minority of U.P students like to brag towards Ateneans, likewise a minority of Ateneans brag against DLSU and so on...but the university rankings are meaningless when you check the board exam passing rate of your specific course. The top 3 medical schools in the country aren't even from the big 4. So course rank is a lot more important than school rank. Ofcourse, don't forget about mental health though.

The silence is deafening. Some of the profs who have been so vocal about issues like martial law etc never spoke up about this particular issue. And now they're opening up about that fucking upsilon scandal like it's the worst shit ever? Fuck you hypocrites.\\n\\nSubmitted: November 23, 2018 10\", '#ADMUFreedomWall17052\\n\\nI think the reason why we really hate Filipino in college is not because of the language, but the topics in it. I’d understand if Filipino was about learning how to speak deeper Tagalog, learning like street tagalog culture, or anything related at our present times. \\nInstead college Filipino (at least what i experienced here) for me had very unnecessary or lack of better term, useless topics. Lol So in Filipino, we learn about a girl falling in love with nature getting horny, we learn about the ancient Filipinos and their super weird cultures, and we are REQUIRED to memorize authors of books that we’ll probably never read again. What I’m trying to say is that these topics are not very applicable in our present society. Sure i can understand a girl loves nature, sure i can study about the ancient Filipino culture, sure i can memorize random authors names, BUT in the end, after I graduate, I’m sure all these things I learned will be forgotten simply because they’re useless. It’s not very applicable in life to talk about authors I memorized lol. I guess thats why people are against the Filipino subject. It’s not because Filipino sucks, it’s more because the topics being taught are really useless...

If poor people peddle goods and throw trash on the sidewalks, you have the authority to remove them, even though it’s anti-poor. If poor people build squatter colonies along esteros and waterways, you have the moral obligation to relocate them, even though it’s anti-poor. Just because something is “anti-poor” doesn’t automatically mean it’s bad. In fact, some “anti-poor” policies may be good for society.

I’m an oldie of the org I assume you are referring to and to be honest I only remained a member because a) I still somehow love my work, and b) I still have very very good friends in the org. Yes they are VERY cliquish. What completely sucks is that there is a sense of “coldness” between the cast and the production teams. Hell cast members don’t even say hi to you when you say hi to them in the theater. For fuck’s sake one time, after I’d just finished doing the show for lights, I stepped out and they told me “Thank you for watching!” as of I were part of the audience. They didn’t even know I’d been there for literally almost every show. This was done to me 4 TIMES. 4 fucking times like holy shit di niyo ba ako kilala or something I try to say hi to you people every fucking time.  To all the people who defend the org and say “Just go to HR. They’re there for a reason,” this isn’t a simple “HR” problem. There’s a problem with how the org has been systematically. There is a lot of nepotism. Some people get positions that they don’t deserve but only get because they’re friends with the PMs. For example, I once applied to be the part of a mainstage second semester production. Prior to applying, I had done 3 org productions, 3 productions for another org, and I’d even done professional work outside of Ateneo. Basically, and not to boast, I was THE ONE for the job. I didn’t get it. Instead, someone who was close with the PM and whose only experience in Technicals was working in set & props got the job. It was incredibly frustrating.  That being said, to the two newbies who have spoken out, I implore you to stay not because of the people. Stay for the craft. It can’t be denied that said org still has great productions (despite a lot of backstage frustration) and the performers are still among the best in the school and even in the Philippines. Love your work. It doesn’t mean you have to love the people along the way. Screw them.

Already skeptical about it, I told them that I\\'ll think about it. Joke\\'s on me for worrying to come off as impolite if I say no.  When the day came that he followed up for my confirmation, I straight up asked the person if it was a network marketing event. He literally said NO THAT IT WASNT. Believing him, I went to the meeting because I trusted him. THAT\\'S WHERE I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.  The speakers of the event were going on about how \"Network Marketing was the best way to earn money\" UGH FUQ IVE BEEN LIED TO AND I FELL FOR IT  I\\'m already laughing at myself for falling for this. But I\\'m sharing this experience to y\\'all AS A CAUTIONARY TALE to avoid people messaging you about a \"business venture\" or a \"business opportunity\", take everything with a grain of salt. If they won\\'t tell you what brand they\\'re working for, don\\'t waste more time entertaining these shady people. If you already think they\\'re dodgey, trust your gut. If you can\\'t find them on the first page of Google, don\\'t even think about it. Network marketers/pyramid scheme scammers make people on the higher wrungs richer. They\\'re stigmatized for a reason. All these skincare/health pharma things may be the bread and butter to some but I hope these people DONT LIE TO PEOPLE JUST SO THEY CAN GET THEIR WAY. It\\'s not impolite to step away when you realize it\\'s a fraudulent invitation.  That\\'s 2.5 hours of my life that I won\\'t get back.

Palapit na ang finals, and for some reason I am still so fuckin attracted to my classmate that I found super duper cute?? Like wth patapos na yung sem tapos wala naman nangyayari. Bobo lang ako. Now I just kinda hate him because wala tangina gusto ko pa rin siya huhu. I gave up on trying to be halaman altogether, but I also kinda gave up on him at some point kasi sobrang wala kaming common friend circles at common activities except that one class we have together. And I was super obvious with him and got the feel na sinusungitan niya ako ergo di siya interested. Tapos out of nowhere kinausap niya ako after class??!?! As in I know that's nbd pero isipin mo. Isipin mo yung sobrang crush na crush mo isang tao tapos sinungitan ka nila, tapos kumbinsado ka na ayaw na ayaw nila sayo tapos biglang kakausapin ka nila?? Naku kuya mahirap yan. I'm so Maropoque™. Kaya ayan naloka ako all over again. Tumingin ulit ako sa horoscope para lang may reference ako of some sort na kung type ba ng sign niya yung girl yung magmamake ng first move?? Honestly sobrang bobo ko lang. Like, am I really gonna base my actions on his natal chart? Tbh probably but sobrang ???  Apparently his sign will try anything once, so I was kinda banking on that?? But ayun, recently, I decided okay fine- I'll ask him out. Fuck it. I'm gonna do it. What's the worst that could happen? I've been rejected several times before. I can handle it.

After asking for some advice, I figured sige I can build up talking to him for a few times muna after class before really asking him out, kahit one meeting lang. So ayun hinahype ko sarili ko, kakausapin ko siya after class.  Ito na. Ito na. Tapos alam mo yung sa movies, yung hahabulin na ng main character yung gusto nila tapos biglang pag nag-pan na yung camera may kasamang iba AGOYYYYYY There was a girl waiting for him na, and they walked together. And like ang sakit mga pare bro. As in feel ko naman tropa lang sila pero alam mo yung sobrang naramdaman ko lang lalo na magka-ibang mundo kami and sobrang longshot talaga. And parang he has enough girls around him, and hindi kami same crowd, so di rin ako tugma sa personality ng mga girls that he usually hangs around.  But also for some reason parang this is the third time since freshman year na I've seen this same girl with a guy I like and parang ate girl tulong how??

Two of them were best friends from way back, even before I became friends with either one of them. I only came along much later (and even became friends with them individually), and three of us have only ever hung out all together twice. Below is me, whenever I imagine losing you both, with you two avoiding me as if I were some fucking Nazi rapist pedophile scum who does not deserve to live. Really wish we can all be friends.

Some people smoke because they think its cool, some people smoke because its part of their routine, but the reason i smoke is because of a girl. A girl whom i love so much it hurts, the urge to see and talk to her is always there. The smile from her angelic face never fails to make me feel loved. But of course where there is light, there is darkness ; it hurts when you feel no comfort from anyone. When the love of your life is no longer yours you feel like nothing matters. She doesnt even care about what you do anymore, she hurt you like you were no one to her. Also Imagine getting betrayed by your friends when you treated them like family yeah that happened to me too. I would even die for them or even help them hide a dead body if they needed me to. Everything hurts to the point you’re numb and you don’t even know yourself anymore. Sometimes you just dont know eho to trust and lean on. That is where my cigarette comes in, it comforts me whenever i feel alone and unwanted. It just makes you forget about the problems that you have as if it comes with the smoke that you release from between your lips. So guys whenever you see a smoker just ask him/her about his/her life dont judge him or her right away because you never know the story behind that burnt cigarette.

As much as I\\'d like to feel better, I don\\'t want to see a doctor/therapist/counselor just to find out I\\'m overstating my problems. Lately I\\'ve just been feeling generally down and that there isn\\'t any point to anything. In the end, we all just die, and trying to \"find meaning\" in things just feels like hedonism to me. Sure, I can be happy and enjoy myself at times, but I don\\'t know if that\\'s just a distraction from how empty I feel. I feel that I can\\'t relate with anyone. Why does it seem like everyone in Ateneo has so many friends and good relationships with other people, while I am just superficially connected to everyone? There are many of the little projects like JSEC challenge/SOM event case studies that need groups but I\\'ve never been able to be part of those because it just seems I\\'m not close enough to anyone to be invited to a group. I don\\'t want burden people with my feelings, and I\\'d rather listen to other people and help them out, but no one tells me anything. I don\\'t know how my blockmates can talk to each other so casually and, y\\'know, connect, when any conversation I start gets killed because it seems no one wants to talk to me.  It\\'s like no one wants to know me. Maybe I\\'m just thinking too much. Everybody knows me as the super extroverted guy that isn\\'t afraid to do anything, the guy with all the jokes and with the boundless energy and a mystic energy source that makes him always feel good.

I am not trying to put down anyone, but would want to give credit to PUP the declared winner of the competition.\\n\\nFirst off, I have a couple of friends part of the team and I know the coaches of the ADMU team and they had no doubts on the results. Something that strikes me more is the fact that the post was shared by 400+ people, but interestingly, among my friends only students from one school shared it and felt strongly against it. While this is obviously the likely outcome since they were the most affected, the proof that Ateneans generally agree with the results is a strong statement in itself. Second, I rewatched the video of PUP and it was really amazing. No doubt that UP also had an amazing presentation, but PUP's plans was really focused and targeted. PUP vs the Ateneo's and UP's showed amazing art vs just showing science. While marketing is heavily dependent on science, at the end of the day science will only bring you so far, it is art that changes the game. I am 100% sure that PUP's art is the real deal. Third, it seems super fishy that the post was super focused and looked like it was written by someone heavily involved in the competition. As an Atenean SOM student who is active in competitions and has a lot of friends in competitions, I can be sure when I say that Ateneans are not as involved unless the ones competing or contributing. This post was probably written by someone really invested or had friends that were really invested. Going back to the first point it seems like the Ateneans really involved here have denied the allegations.  Fourth, the judges are all credible and are huge in the marketing organization. This does not mean they are not prone to fraud, but it also means that they have no gain already and most of them aren't doing this for money but they really believe in the future of marketing. In summary, I'm not saying that the post is false. That's the beauty and ugly of anonymity. We can never be too sure. However, given the points above, it is unfair to PUP that there are lots of bashers. We need to give credit where it is due. PUP was great. Whether you believed they were the best or not is your opinion. For the sets of judges, and for a lot of other students, PUP was the clear winner.

At what point do we draw the line between saying that it is okay to do it out of love, and saying that the girl, is simply too toxic for the boy and simply abuses his kindness?   again, this can conversely happen the other way around wherein the male is the more dominant figure and that the female gets treated and taken advantage of simply because she was kind.  hoping for some great feedback!

Only to find out when I asked a friend kung nakakakuha ba sila ng comission ay aba, wala. 650 and none of the artists gets anything. Funds daw para sa party. Seems a bit unethical. Even worse is nakita ko yung quality ng cards kasi may kaibigan akong bumili... sana ako na lang pumrint. Hindi po ganoon ka mahal magprint ng ganung quality. Ibig sabihin sobrang laki ng patong sa cards, hindi pumupunta sa artists, at pumunta sa napakasupot na party. Very disappointing ID seniors, but the ones who are managing the finances especially.

Then they got highly annoyed that I edited their parts so much, to the point that I essentialy re-did it. Meanwhile, I actually had not yet done my part.

Is it your wit, your conviction to stand up for what you believe in, your empathy and kindness. Maybe it’s all of the above, all I know is that I’m hopelessly in love. \\n I thought I could be mature about this, there’s no need to complicate friendship with an unnecessary relationship. You’re always so busy with work and studies yet you always manage to find time for me. Our little dinners I notice you’re always so tired yet you still try to stay attentive to me. Maybe it’s just me but you trying for me just makes me so happy I just wanna make you happy in the same way.

MALAMANG URE FROM A TEAM.  the least you could have done was to write the post better??? \\n tbh, it’s so evident that it’s just you guys who gives this big of a shit for this whole thing? like damn, chill out. get over it.  Why can’t we just be happy for a school that doesn’t win so often? Personally, the PUP win was expected. Yes, the judges’ comments were off at times, and yes UP’s presentation was no doubt some great shit… but PUP’s was overall the most realistic and doable campaign. Offhand, UP’s campaign seemed like a tourism campaign that just inserted sustainability. PUP’s campaign effectively highlighted the sustainability aspect. YES, the jingle was their strong point.. but really, realistically, a jingle goes a long way especially with their target market. I see how the judges could really lean towards their campaign.  “If we lose to a fucking jingle, tangina lang.” - UP PANA team member heard outside Irwin.  Please stop being such obnoxious and entitled people with this. When the PUP team won, the least you could have done was to try to be happy for them. Crying on stage and making a scene at the side or Irwin after the awarding was just so tasteless. It reflects so much on how entitled you are. We get that you always win. Sadly, it seems to have gotten to your head. Para kayong mga bata eh, mga iyakin.  It was not in losing to PUP that you lost your pride. It was in how you reacted when you got second place. With the way you acted, and are acting to invalidate their win, you are a disgrace to the marketing community. Nakakahiya kayo and it’s disgusting. In this case, you are definitely not deserving of winning.  Please get off your high horse, get your heads out of your asses, and get off of our freedom wall. Stop using ADMU’s platform for your dirty shit.  SIT DOWN. BE HUMBLE.  If you can’t take losing, then don’t join the competition.

I remember how UP Visayas had an amazing race as an execution and part of it was doing/making a bonfire. She even told them how bonfires were illegal and they should have done their homework to know that it's illegal. Pero when PUP recommended Laboracay 2.0, which again, was already illegal, she just laughed it off and gave a sarcastic comment. If that isn't bias then idk what is. I hope the other people who were there speak up as well. If PUP believes that they deserve that award, they should be willing to have PANA post all the videos.

If you go back to my post you\\'d see I actually commended them and their campaign. I\\'m attacking the mechanism and the \"system\" that runs in that organization. Para matapos na lahat, I just want PANA to post the criteria, the videos of all the presentations, and the breakdown of scores. I\\'m sure everyone would appreciate that. If PUP is certain that they check off all the criteria then what\\'s there to fear? I understand the fact that the scoring may be objective to some extent but for things that you can clearly quantify, like say specific marketing technicalities, dun talaga magkakatalo. Both teams presented great campaigns, it\\'s just that as for marketing technicalities, the other really stood out clearly. A video including the Q&A would be great too. That\\'s where you\\'ll see how the judges didn\\'t grill PUP at all when there were lots of things that can possibly be questioned vs all the rest of the teams, not just UP. Everyone else was grilled for the algorithms of their apps/sites etc, for the sustainability aspect. Accountability and transparency, PANA. That wouldn\\'t be difficult to give if everything was well-deserved.

They mention how we should just focus on sports like billiards and football or some other height appropriate game. They say that basketball programs should be defunded and that we should literally just play for the medals.\\n\\nHere's the reality. You aren't going to convince any young basketball player to play football by defunding basketball programs. These people play basketball because it's an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because it's what they want, it's what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids aren't playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country won't produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldn't even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but I'd rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they don't give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball won't turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you can't convince a person who loves Kyrie Irving's insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal. A gold medal which he doesn't give a shit about, a medal only there so that Filipinos can brag about being Filipinos.

I watched you pretend to appreciate the Disney minus one from our shitty seats by the entrance to the park.

I took you to see the lights last Friday.\\n I saw how your arms and legs tried to move the least amount, rather sore from your special event you never wanted to go to. I watched the manner you kept yourself folded and reserved. Power saving mode. Save your energy for the long trip home and all your bags to carry plus your school things. I bargained to keep some with me, you kissed me as if in reluctant relief. When I stopped taking a photo I found myself staring at how your eyes were watching everything in tired, forced wonder. Trying so hard to make this moment beautiful. I felt your hand in mine. I felt the squeeze and the slight turn to see if I got flustered enough to glow like the lights against the pitch black Makati night. You smiled tiredly, as if you wanted to wake up to see me once more when your mind is in better states. You mouthed an \"I love you\" even before mine could tumble out of my lips. I took you to see the lights last Friday. And I fell in love with you all over again, my starlight.

Most of the cars being tested on the circuit back then were Nissan creations, specifically those from the Z lineup and the Skyline lineup. To see a car from another manufacturer was a little unheard of then. So when the RE Amemiya team came to the circuit one day, it was a move that few expected. But what happened that day is something that only the team had really anticipated for. In 1987, RE Amemiya became legend for setting one of the fastest time records that Yatabe has ever seen. But how? It was with the FORTIS RX-7 that magic happened. Using a combination of 13 years of Rotary engine tuning experience and carefully crafted parts (a majority of which were created by RE Amemiya themselves) the car had its power output increased to 440PS. And so it was on that fateful day that the fast yet stable FORTIS RX-7 was able to hit a top speed of 315.1km/h, a record in Yatabe for both rotary and non-rotary cars alike. Extremely proud of the results, RE-Amemiya participated in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon, where the car won a grand prize in the auto salon's tuned car division.\\n Because of the FORTIS RX-7's success on both the track and the show, RE Amemiya decided to revamp her for the following year, strengthening her in both aspects. 1988 turned out to be both a good year and a bad year for the car, as though the FORTIS RX-7 failed to set any new records in \\n Yatabe, the car won the Tudor Card Excellence Award in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon.  It was in 1988 where the trail ended though.  The last records that I could find for the car was from that year, and then the following year in 1989, the trail goes cold. Nobody knows the whereabouts of the car, and even those who were possibly actively searching then most likely came up empty-handed. In fact, aside from a single page that showcases the car's spec list and its achievements, RE Amemiya seems to have mostly forgotten about the car, especially in light with their later tuning achievements like the Super GT GT300 RX7. If it weren't for a certain Japanese Tuner Magazine's video, I probably wouldn't have even knew that this ever existed!  But here it is. I don't know how I found it, but I sure am glad I am to be able to share this forgotten piece of history with you guys. Just looking at the pics made me realize that the car would still look dope even today. Enjoy!

Maybe I’ll wake up on time. Thank yooooou!\\n\\nSubmitted: November 18, 2018 5', '#ADMUFreedomWall16619\\n\\nThis is my opinion but I think that an underlying problem with ADMU is that it discourages its students from walking around, given how certain important buildings like Bellarmine Hall and ISO are located FAR AWAY from where most of the Loyola School (LS) buildings are clustered. Meanwhile the really niche buildings like PIPAC, the freshman dorm halls (Cervini/Eliazo), and even the ASOG are located closer to LS. It\\'s why students complain a lot about their BEL-CTC scheds and you can\\'t blame them since they were probably batch 2 and were forced to pick those BEL classes next to their CTC classes. In any case, it still doesn\\'t take away my point that the way ADMU has been planned has been quite crap. Instead of devoting so much money on creating more and maintaining existing parking spaces and encouraging students to bring their cars, they should\\'ve just focus on relocating the important buildings like cafeterias and BEL/FA ANNEX buildings closer to the LS area. This would\\'ve perhaps lead students to rely less on their cars, which will eventually reduce the need for parking spaces, and use those other remaining spaces as ports for trikes and other public transpo. That way, that remaining space will take up even less space compared to the already existing parking spaces. Even so, it would also help create more space for more trees = more shade = relatively cooler campus. At the very least I do hope they could at least make their existing buildings more \"green\" (though I\\'m not saying that in a Lasallian way). I mean, allowing vertical gardens to be a thing in the existing building clusters like Leong Hall, Rizal Libs, Soc Sci, De La Costa, etc.  Regardless, what Ateneo should be doing is making its campus even more pedestrian friendly, since in all honesty, it\\'s one of the best campuses to stroll around.  Thus, making it more \"walkable\" will perhaps help ease out the traffic outside Katipunan. #UrbanPlanningADMU  Submitted:  November 18, 2018 5:42:52 PM +08', '#ADMUFreedomWall16618\\n\\nI understand that for the past 3 years, many of us have mocked \"Ang Probinsyano\" for being too \"pang-masa\" and treated it as a lower form of entertainment, when we fail to recognize that the show is still a form of art that reflects the current human condition, and its depiction of the police force is only a reaction of the present.

Well I have been feeling like that kanina while I was being used for printing and cutting out business cards. It was around 10am when my brother asked me to print out 17 sheets of business cards (9 per sheet) on a short bond paper ole he was at a bazaar. So I printed 10 sheets on a wrong paper since it was too thin. Then, I printed another 17 on another paper that’s somewhat thicker, spent my time cutting then according to those outlines of the cards, and arranging in an orderly manner. (Of course I didn’t cut them all yet since I also had to work on my deliverable for my major) When he arrived home, he saw that I was cutting and stacking them. He was glad until my mom pointed out that the paper I used was too thin for a business card. I’m a college undergrad and I don’t have an internship yet so don’t expect me to find a specific kind of paper for that. Another is that he didn’t mention what kind of short bond paper he wanted me to use (carboard paper) so I have nothing to be ashamed of. Seriously, galit na ako ah and I have other things to do other than your pathetic business cards. I was really planning to do a report and my project deliverable on the same day. I’m tired na and I don’t want to cram UGH. If you would have told me the night before, I would set my time to do it. But now, it’s like I don’t want to help you anymore.

Para sa akin kasi requirement pa rin dapat ang Filipino. Ito ay dahil kahit na paulit-ulit na nating pinag-aaralan yan, kailangan pa rin nating isanay ang ating mga sarili sa paggamit nito nang tama na tipong magsisilbi siyang paraan para mas maintindihan ka ng mga ibang tao lalo na sa mga taong wala namang background sa English. \\n2. Para sa akin kasi kailangan mo ipractice nang ipractice ang Filipino kasi kung matagal mo na siyang hindi nagagamit sa tingin mo ba yung galing mo sa pagsalita ng Filipino noon parehas pa rin ba siya pagkatapos ng matagal na panahon ng hindi mo paggamit nito? Parang math lang yan, hindi porket napag-aralan mo na siya noon, maalala mo na agad kung paano mo isolve ang isang problem after ng ilang yrs na hindi mo paggamit nito. [Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino. Siya na rin mismo nagsabi na nakalimutan na rin niya paano yung mga balarila sa Filipino. (May ganun talagang case believe it or not meng)]\\n 3. Para kanino ba tayo? (Medyo pareho lang punto ko dito at sa 1) Hindi ba ito nakakalungkot? Para sa akin, kaya natin ito ginagawa kasi para makapagsilbi tayo sa mga taong wala namang oportunidad. Hindi ba kaya may wika kasi para mas magkaroon ng maayos na komunikasyon sa mga tao? Kung hindi naman mapapalalim ang kaalaman natin tungkol sa wika natin, paano tayo magiging matagumpay sa pagtulong ng mga taong nasa mga laylayan? Alam mo ba na may mga batas nga na para sa mga kasambahay, magsasaka, atbp. pero halos lahat naman ng mga taong kabilang sa dito, wala naman gaanong alam tungkol dito kasi naka-English yung batas natin. Hindi pa nila maintindihan. Yung layunin na makapagpaalam sa mga taong makikinabang sana sa mga ito, wala na agad dahil doon. So ayun, hindi ko alam kung napakita ko ba yung kahalagahan ng pag-aral nito kahit sa kolehiyo haha sana makuha kahit konti lang hindi ako magaling makipagdebate tungkol sa isyu na ito nakakatrigger ka lang (sinubukan ko rin maging purong Filipino yung sasabihin ko dito, pero kita mo naman di ba haha sana marealize mo yun hehe peace!)

I find it very convenient to be able to help in finding parking but this gives more people a reason to bring a car. Now all of us who usually bring a car and live far away have to fight even worse for parking spots in the school. Moreover, actually having a means to enable lot reservation through whatever means may lead a chance to having other people’s cars stay longer just so that their friend or whoever they are messaging to be able to take the spot after them (hopefully people are better than this). I do strongly encourage not to add a lot reservation scheme because the parking will be full at all times especially at peak hours if many people will be using the app.  Anyways best of wishes on the app development. Thanks for reading.

I am falling for you. How can I not? You have the most perfect face. You are f*king handsome. You are smart, You are responsible. You are funny. You are decent. You have so many girls crushing on you but you don't care about them. You are ambitious. You are everything good and I respect you. As your best friend, I am lucky to be the person you hug, you hold hands with, you send selfies to, you share food with, you wait for, you reserve a seat for, you offer your shoulder to sleep on... Sometimes, i wonder, do you like me? If so, are these the signals? Are you waiting for me to affirm this?  But i really don't know. Coz when we aren't in school, you rarely call or text. I know you said that you aren't ready for any relationship yet but you know, i can wait. But i wanna know if my wait is going to be worthwhile. When you told me not to leave you ever and I said yes, i really meant it. YOu said you were kilig and I wonder what that meant? Is this purely friendship? Coz you know i really like you and i wished that you would give me hints if you like me. Just so as you know, not all chinese girls have the great wall. If that's what is stopping you. And even if there was a great wall for me, I know that you are someone my parents will surely accept. I know i'm not the prettiest girl, i'm sure you have prettier ones waiting in line. I'm not the smartest either, you know that.  Am I too ambitious? Well, you know it's really hard to be pretending all the time.  When you hold my hand, i want to lock it in mine forever. When you hug me, i want to stay that way forever. When you say don't leave me, i wanted to tell you I will be here forever.... #ME freshie in love with bestfriend Submitted:  November 13, 2018 4:50:01 PM +08\", \"#ADMUFreedomWall16166\\n\\nI'm desperate so: to whoever found my blue pencil case (for specifics, content includes usb, 3 colored highlighters and some index cards) please comment down huhuhuhu :((( been going to lost and found and it still hasn't been reported :(((\\n\\nSubmitted: November 13, 2018 2\", '#ADMUFreedomWall16159\\n\\nkapag busted ka ni crush, sabi sayo \"shit ka kasi\"\\n.\\nkailangan balikan mo \"at least free na ako sa butas ng pwet mo la ka pang ano eh\"\\n .

It makes me feel like I am forced to come up with a presentation every time my family and I are seated together. Look, I am not like my brother at all who talks about anything. I understand the advantages of talking with people but I rather be alone so I can be in peace (I really hate noise). I tend to be social sometimes, especially when I’m with my friends, but I WILL NOT CHANGE MYSELF FROM BEING AN INTROVERT. No matter how many times you have been asking regarding my personality, don’t hope for a change, dad. It’s really disgusting and I really can’t do that because it’s unhealthy for me.

I mean gets, you can google the summary of the topic or something, but bitch was just GOOGLING EVERYTHING - even the tagline or motto or anything we had to put in the docs. The worst part was our group didn\\'t know each other, and she was the most vocal one. So when we started suggesting things, and everyone was agreeing except her. She was just like, \"uhh i don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea *GOOGLES* i think this is a better idea! *shows vague article*\" and every time someone suggested something, she kept turning it down. That person knew she had little knowledge about the topic that\\'s why she was googling, and people who were more informed about it were shelling out good ideas. But since people weren\\'t close with each other and she was the most vocal one, she just turned down everyone\\'s ideas by pointing out whats wrong with it and how those ideas were a \"hassle.\" Wala lang I\\'m from SOM also but sometimes, after 4 years in Ateneo, I still get amazed at how people in this school (JGSOM) lack sooooo much creativity.

Just recently, I managed to get my guy to help me climb it. I regret it.\\n\\nContext: I had been seeing this guy for almost an entire year. We told each other we were in love with the other, but for an entire year he refused to tell his parents about how he felt towards me. In a turn of events, he finally did.  His mother and father were a lot more bigoted than I thought. They threatened to stop paying for his education. They cried. They acted as if he was throwing his future away, and kept on insisting that even if I was \"a nice girl,\" my family was the one he should be wary of. His dad even mentioned that marrying a Filipina was a death sentence for any reasonable, successful businessman because no one wanted to do business with someone who had the audacity to marry what they generally think is an ugly gold digger.  I felt angry. Not only were they disrespecting me, they were disrespecting my family. My mom and dad hold masters degrees/PhDs and were academic and financial scholars respectively. They have made a respectable living out of their jobs and have even been expatriated in the past. His parents have no right to generalize that we\\'re so money hungry and classless that I\\'d go for their eldest son in order to sustain us. It made me realize that all the agony and kasawian we go through in trying to \"climb the great wall\" is degrading and useless. If you respect yourself enough, don\\'t grovel at their feet. Don\\'t give them that power.  I love him, yes, but I love myself too. It took me a year to find that love and self-respect to just accept it\\'s not going to happen. The best you can do is change this generation\\'s mind about Filipino-Chinese relationships, but don\\'t bet on it that you\\'ll get your own happy ending in this one.

I'm basically an adult who's capable of making decisions, but since I still live under their roof, I have no rights apparently. I don't know why they're like this to me. I have good grades naman and I'm not the type who'll be 'pariwara' or something like that. I'm not that stupid, and I really value my acads.  I came across this tweet and I relate so much to it. It's true what they say na 'strict parents raise the best liars.' I still manage to sneak out and party every now and then. I have a solid group of friends who always cover for me. They understand my situation and they want me to have some fun din naman. I noticed that the kids with stricter parents are the ones who become the wildest pa nga sa mga parties. They want to seize every opportunity they get to go out kasi so they end up getting wasted talaga or really promiscous.  Dear parents, you're not doing your kids a favor by being outright controlling. If you constantly invade their privacy, they're just going to rebel and resent you forever for it. It'll just strain your relationship with your child, and they wouldn't be comfortable talking about what's going on in their lives with you anymore. If you have concerns with them drinking or having sexual relations then talk to them about it. Go set boundaries and explain your concerns, but don't forget to listen to your child's side din. We're not little kids anymore, we know what's right and wrong. We can look after ourselves if only you let us.

I've been in your place, and even though it's not the exact same experience, I have an understanding of what it feels like to want to commit suicide. I get it; it's your life. Who am I to dictate your happiness? But your death will at least affect that person telling you not to die. Sure, you can argue that it's selfish of them to want you to live. The concept of wants and motivations are technically selfish. But the grief they would feel towards your death isn't genuine because it's selfish for them to not want to experience that? Bullshit. Aren't you the one being truly selfish for dismissing their feelings? Off yourself if you really want. It's ultimately your choice. But know that even if you were to die and it would be cause for grief, at least I would not blame you for following through with it because I acknowledge your feelings. I'm not going to (and I can't) force you to live, but at the very least acknowledge the feelings of those around you who don't want you to die too.

I was taking my usual route out of Ateneo — I\\'d exit from CTC then make my way through SOM forest until I arrived at the covered path to Gate 2.5. But once I reached the forest, I knew there was something wrong. The hair on my arms stood up as I surveyed the unnaturally dark surrounding. I noticed that it was too quiet, as if the whole forest was holding its breath. Despite this, I braved on, determined to get home. And anyways, it was just a short path. What was the worst that could happen, right? As I walked, the post about the Rendezvous Girl popped in my head. I shrugged the thoughts away — it was just another silly story for scaring people. Also, I\\'m a girl. I was sure that the offer of \"free head\" wouldn\\'t apply to me.  In the distance, I could already see the lights from the covered pathway. With newfound courage (and a bit of smugness), I jokingly whispered \"Rendezvous\". As the word escaped my lips, a chill emitted from behind me. Every cell in my body was shouting for me to run, but I turned around anyway.  That\\'s when I saw him. The first thing I noticed was the paper bag on his head. Up to now, the crudely drawn smiley is still branded in my memory. My eyes went down, trailing over his naked and grimy body, until they settled over a smaller paper bag, with a similar smiley, covering his nether region. In another situation, I would have found it funny, but at that moment, all I felt was fear.  He tilted his head to the side and curled his index finger two times, a summon for me to draw nearer. I can\\'t explain it, but I took a step toward him. I was only 5 feet away when the lower paper bag fell off. A scream formed in the back of my throat as I saw the mangled and rotting remains of his phallus. A thick fetid gooey liquid was spurting out, and maggots were crawling through holes in the skin. I finally ran, the fastest that I\\'ve ever ran in my life, all the way to Gate 2.5, then all the way home.  But what happened in SOM forest stayed with me. Every night, I dream of Rendezvous Guy. Every night, he beckons me to come back. And every night, I feel myself slowly giving in. Submitted:  September 30, 2018 12:52:20 PM +08', '#ADMUFreedomWall9970\\n\\nMinimum wage must be abolished.

Borderline suicidal already and stuff but what really encouraged me and made me smile despite the pain was when I got on the phone with my sister in the CR in SEC B then I guess the Ate overheard my conversation.

If anything, I generally see anyone bandying around comments like \"haha 3guarD sjw cuckés\" as someone unwilling to engage ideas head-on and get to the bottom of things. - Nobody is apolitical. Everything is political. Lines are drawn every time someone declares himself a \"neutral party\" to an issue. More often than not, neutrality is rooted in the belief that you have no stake in the issue, that it isn\\'t important enough from your point of view to care. But for the labor-only contractual worker, the knife of unemployment, poverty, and hunger is constantly cold on his neck.

I’d understand if Filipino was about learning how to speak deeper Tagalog, learning like street tagalog culture, or anything related at our present times. \\nInstead college Filipino (at least what i experienced here) for me had very unnecessary or lack of better term, useless topics. Lol So in Filipino, we learn about a girl falling in love with nature getting horny, we learn about the ancient Filipinos and their super weird cultures, and we are REQUIRED to memorize authors of books that we’ll probably never read again. What I’m trying to say is that these topics are not very applicable in our present society. Sure i can understand a girl loves nature, sure i can study about the ancient Filipino culture, sure i can memorize random authors names, BUT in the end, after I graduate, I’m sure all these things I learned will be forgotten simply because they’re useless. It’s not very applicable in life to talk about authors I memorized lol. I guess thats why people are against the Filipino subject. It’s not because Filipino sucks, it’s more because the topics being taught are really useless...

If poor people peddle goods and throw trash on the sidewalks, you have the authority to remove them, even though it’s anti-poor. If poor people build squatter colonies along esteros and waterways, you have the moral obligation to relocate them, even though it’s anti-poor. Just because something is “anti-poor” doesn’t automatically mean it’s bad. In fact, some “anti-poor” policies may be good for society.

I’m an oldie of the org I assume you are referring to and to be honest I only remained a member because a) I still somehow love my work, and b) I still have very very good friends in the org. Yes they are VERY cliquish. What completely sucks is that there is a sense of “coldness” between the cast and the production teams. Hell cast members don’t even say hi to you when you say hi to them in the theater. For fuck’s sake one time, after I’d just finished doing the show for lights, I stepped out and they told me “Thank you for watching!” as of I were part of the audience. They didn’t even know I’d been there for literally almost every show. This was done to me 4 TIMES. 4 fucking times like holy shit di niyo ba ako kilala or something I try to say hi to you people every fucking time.  To all the people who defend the org and say “Just go to HR. They’re there for a reason,” this isn’t a simple “HR” problem. There’s a problem with how the org has been systematically. There is a lot of nepotism. Some people get positions that they don’t deserve but only get because they’re friends with the PMs. For example, I once applied to be the part of a mainstage second semester production. Prior to applying, I had done 3 org productions, 3 productions for another org, and I’d even done professional work outside of Ateneo. Basically, and not to boast, I was THE ONE for the job. I didn’t get it. Instead, someone who was close with the PM and whose only experience in Technicals was working in set & props got the job. It was incredibly frustrating.  That being said, to the two newbies who have spoken out, I implore you to stay not because of the people. Stay for the craft. It can’t be denied that said org still has great productions (despite a lot of backstage frustration) and the performers are still among the best in the school and even in the Philippines. Love your work. It doesn’t mean you have to love the people along the way. Screw them.

It's embedded in our brains; the smartest guys get rewarded; the failures don't graduate. But we aren't just students; we aren't robots. We are people.\\n\\nWe are not limited to the things that try to put us in a box. We all have our own form of beauty and intelligence and our lives are about using it to it's fullest potential. It's not about grades. It's not about what you get, but who you become.  So if you're reading this, and you're going through a tough time in these final weeks, remember that while you always do your best, never think that you have something to prove to anyone, that you're trying to validate something.

Palapit na ang finals, and for some reason I am still so fuckin attracted to my classmate that I found super duper cute?? Like wth patapos na yung sem tapos wala naman nangyayari. Bobo lang ako. Now I just kinda hate him because wala tangina gusto ko pa rin siya huhu. I gave up on trying to be halaman altogether, but I also kinda gave up on him at some point kasi sobrang wala kaming common friend circles at common activities except that one class we have together. And I was super obvious with him and got the feel na sinusungitan niya ako ergo di siya interested. Tapos out of nowhere kinausap niya ako after class??!?! As in I know that's nbd pero isipin mo. Isipin mo yung sobrang crush na crush mo isang tao tapos sinungitan ka nila, tapos kumbinsado ka na ayaw na ayaw nila sayo tapos biglang kakausapin ka nila?? Naku kuya mahirap yan. I'm so Maropoque™. Kaya ayan naloka ako all over again. Tumingin ulit ako sa horoscope para lang may reference ako of some sort na kung type ba ng sign niya yung girl yung magmamake ng first move?? Honestly sobrang bobo ko lang. Like, am I really gonna base my actions on his natal chart? Tbh probably but sobrang ???  Apparently his sign will try anything once, so I was kinda banking on that?? But ayun, recently, I decided okay fine- I'll ask him out. Fuck it. I'm gonna do it. What's the worst that could happen? I've been rejected several times before. I can handle it.  And I started telling people na parang okay I'm gonna do it, kahit na sobrang mukhang cannot be, susubukan ko kasi I will never know for sure. After asking for some advice, I figured sige I can build up talking to him for a few times muna after class before really asking him out, kahit one meeting lang. So ayun hinahype ko sarili ko, kakausapin ko siya after class.  Ito na. Ito na. Tapos alam mo yung sa movies, yung hahabulin na ng main character yung gusto nila tapos biglang pag nag-pan na yung camera may kasamang iba AGOYYYYYY There was a girl waiting for him na, and they walked together. And like ang sakit mga pare bro. As in feel ko naman tropa lang sila pero alam mo yung sobrang naramdaman ko lang lalo na magka-ibang mundo kami and sobrang longshot talaga. And parang he has enough girls around him, and hindi kami same crowd, so di rin ako tugma sa personality ng mga girls that he usually hangs around.  But also for some reason parang this is the third time since freshman year na I've seen this same girl with a guy I like and parang ate girl tulong how??

Some people smoke because they think its cool, some people smoke because its part of their routine, but the reason i smoke is because of a girl. A girl whom i love so much it hurts, the urge to see and talk to her is always there. The smile from her angelic face never fails to make me feel loved. But of course where there is light, there is darkness ; it hurts when you feel no comfort from anyone. When the love of your life is no longer yours you feel like nothing matters. She doesnt even care about what you do anymore, she hurt you like you were no one to her. Also Imagine getting betrayed by your friends when you treated them like family yeah that happened to me too. I would even die for them or even help them hide a dead body if they needed me to. Everything hurts to the point you’re numb and you don’t even know yourself anymore. Sometimes you just dont know eho to trust and lean on. That is where my cigarette comes in, it comforts me whenever i feel alone and unwanted. It just makes you forget about the problems that you have as if it comes with the smoke that you release from between your lips. So guys whenever you see a smoker just ask him/her about his/her life dont judge him or her right away because you never know the story behind that burnt cigarette.

As much as I\\'d like to feel better, I don\\'t want to see a doctor/therapist/counselor just to find out I\\'m overstating my problems. Lately I\\'ve just been feeling generally down and that there isn\\'t any point to anything. In the end, we all just die, and trying to \"find meaning\" in things just feels like hedonism to me. Sure, I can be happy and enjoy myself at times, but I don\\'t know if that\\'s just a distraction from how empty I feel. I feel that I can\\'t relate with anyone. Why does it seem like everyone in Ateneo has so many friends and good relationships with other people, while I am just superficially connected to everyone? There are many of the little projects like JSEC challenge/SOM event case studies that need groups but I\\'ve never been able to be part of those because it just seems I\\'m not close enough to anyone to be invited to a group. I don\\'t want burden people with my feelings, and I\\'d rather listen to other people and help them out, but no one tells me anything. I don\\'t know how my blockmates can talk to each other so casually and, y\\'know, connect, when any conversation I start gets killed because it seems no one wants to talk to me.  It\\'s like no one wants to know me. Maybe I\\'m just thinking too much. Everybody knows me as the super extroverted guy that isn\\'t afraid to do anything, the guy with all the jokes and with the boundless energy and a mystic energy source that makes him always feel good.

I am not trying to put down anyone, but would want to give credit to PUP the declared winner of the competition.\\n\\nFirst off, I have a couple of friends part of the team and I know the coaches of the ADMU team and they had no doubts on the results. Something that strikes me more is the fact that the post was shared by 400+ people, but interestingly, among my friends only students from one school shared it and felt strongly against it. While this is obviously the likely outcome since they were the most affected, the proof that Ateneans generally agree with the results is a strong statement in itself. Second, I rewatched the video of PUP and it was really amazing. No doubt that UP also had an amazing presentation, but PUP's plans was really focused and targeted. PUP vs the Ateneo's and UP's showed amazing art vs just showing science. While marketing is heavily dependent on science, at the end of the day science will only bring you so far, it is art that changes the game. I am 100% sure that PUP's art is the real deal. Third, it seems super fishy that the post was super focused and looked like it was written by someone heavily involved in the competition. As an Atenean SOM student who is active in competitions and has a lot of friends in competitions, I can be sure when I say that Ateneans are not as involved unless the ones competing or contributing. This post was probably written by someone really invested or had friends that were really invested. Going back to the first point it seems like the Ateneans really involved here have denied the allegations.  Fourth, the judges are all credible and are huge in the marketing organization. This does not mean they are not prone to fraud, but it also means that they have no gain already and most of them aren't doing this for money but they really believe in the future of marketing. In summary, I'm not saying that the post is false. That's the beauty and ugly of anonymity. We can never be too sure. However, given the points above, it is unfair to PUP that there are lots of bashers. We need to give credit where it is due. PUP was great. Whether you believed they were the best or not is your opinion. For the sets of judges, and for a lot of other students, PUP was the clear winner.

At what point do we draw the line between saying that it is okay to do it out of love, and saying that the girl, is simply too toxic for the boy and simply abuses his kindness?   again, this can conversely happen the other way around wherein the male is the more dominant figure and that the female gets treated and taken advantage of simply because she was kind.  hoping for some great feedback!

Only to find out when I asked a friend kung nakakakuha ba sila ng comission ay aba, wala. 650 and none of the artists gets anything. Funds daw para sa party. Seems a bit unethical. Even worse is nakita ko yung quality ng cards kasi may kaibigan akong bumili... sana ako na lang pumrint. Hindi po ganoon ka mahal magprint ng ganung quality. Ibig sabihin sobrang laki ng patong sa cards, hindi pumupunta sa artists, at pumunta sa napakasupot na party. Very disappointing ID seniors, but the ones who are managing the finances especially.

Why can’t we just be happy for a school that doesn’t win so often? Personally, the PUP win was expected. Yes, the judges’ comments were off at times, and yes UP’s presentation was no doubt some great shit… but PUP’s was overall the most realistic and doable campaign. Offhand, UP’s campaign seemed like a tourism campaign that just inserted sustainability. PUP’s campaign effectively highlighted the sustainability aspect. YES, the jingle was their strong point.. but really, realistically, a jingle goes a long way especially with their target market. I see how the judges could really lean towards their campaign.  “If we lose to a fucking jingle, tangina lang.” - UP PANA team member heard outside Irwin.  Please stop being such obnoxious and entitled people with this. When the PUP team won, the least you could have done was to try to be happy for them. Crying on stage and making a scene at the side or Irwin after the awarding was just so tasteless. It reflects so much on how entitled you are. We get that you always win. Sadly, it seems to have gotten to your head. Para kayong mga bata eh, mga iyakin.  It was not in losing to PUP that you lost your pride. It was in how you reacted when you got second place. With the way you acted, and are acting to invalidate their win, you are a disgrace to the marketing community. Nakakahiya kayo and it’s disgusting.

When I'm with you, I think about spaces.\\n Bus rides are bumpy and I often pass it asleep. Sometimes I hear the soft rustling of cloth as I take a nap and find your jacket draped against my chest, blanketing you and I from the blast of the overworked aircon.

When I'm with you, I think about spaces.\\n Often times, things are busy and dates compose of you and I talking to other people on our phones. It can't be helped. Work and acads don't have a curfew. We may be mentally in other places but your hand is on mine right as my phone is deposited in my bag.\\n I look up and see your patient smile. You call out my shyness after all this time as if I don't always get flustered by your comforting touch. I feel the redness in my ears bloom.

I remember how UP Visayas had an amazing race as an execution and part of it was doing/making a bonfire. She even told them how bonfires were illegal and they should have done their homework to know that it's illegal. Pero when PUP recommended Laboracay 2.0, which again, was already illegal, she just laughed it off and gave a sarcastic comment. If that isn't bias then idk what is. I hope the other people who were there speak up as well. If PUP believes that they deserve that award, they should be willing to have PANA post all the videos.

If you go back to my post you\\'d see I actually commended them and their campaign. I\\'m attacking the mechanism and the \"system\" that runs in that organization. Para matapos na lahat, I just want PANA to post the criteria, the videos of all the presentations, and the breakdown of scores. I\\'m sure everyone would appreciate that. If PUP is certain that they check off all the criteria then what\\'s there to fear? I understand the fact that the scoring may be objective to some extent but for things that you can clearly quantify, like say specific marketing technicalities, dun talaga magkakatalo. Both teams presented great campaigns, it\\'s just that as for marketing technicalities, the other really stood out clearly. A video including the Q&A would be great too. That\\'s where you\\'ll see how the judges didn\\'t grill PUP at all when there were lots of things that can possibly be questioned vs all the rest of the teams, not just UP. Everyone else was grilled for the algorithms of their apps/sites etc, for the sustainability aspect. Accountability and transparency, PANA. That wouldn\\'t be difficult to give if everything was well-deserved. I hope all PANA teams encourage this for the sake of transparency. :) Submitted:  November 20, 2018 1:16:06 AM +08', '#ADMUFreedomWall16741\\n\\nidc how u much u try to sell that idea, but [org] is not a family. it only welcomes u if youre fun and pabida. it barely acknowledges the shy-er members of the community.\\n\\nSubmitted: November 20, 2018 1', '#ADMUFreedomWall16740\\n\\nOverheard someone say that -1/2 is greater than -1/3\\n\\nuHMMM  Submitted:  November 20, 2018 1:03:19 AM +08', '#ADMUFreedomWall16739\\n\\n#ADMUFreedomWall16732\\n\\nFunny how PUP is pretending they didn’t write this post when it really seems like they did.

They mention how we should just focus on sports like billiards and football or some other height appropriate game. They say that basketball programs should be defunded and that we should literally just play for the medals.\\n\\nHere's the reality. You aren't going to convince any young basketball player to play football by defunding basketball programs. These people play basketball because it's an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because it's what they want, it's what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids aren't playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country won't produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldn't even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but I'd rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they don't give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball won't turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you can't convince a person who loves Kyrie Irving's insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal. A gold medal which he doesn't give a shit about, a medal only there so that Filipinos can brag about being Filipinos.

I took you to see the lights last Friday.\\n I saw how your arms and legs tried to move the least amount, rather sore from your special event you never wanted to go to. I watched the manner you kept yourself folded and reserved. Power saving mode. Save your energy for the long trip home and all your bags to carry plus your school things. I bargained to keep some with me, you kissed me as if in reluctant relief. When I stopped taking a photo I found myself staring at how your eyes were watching everything in tired, forced wonder. Trying so hard to make this moment beautiful. I felt your hand in mine. I felt the squeeze and the slight turn to see if I got flustered enough to glow like the lights against the pitch black Makati night.

Most of the cars being tested on the circuit back then were Nissan creations, specifically those from the Z lineup and the Skyline lineup. To see a car from another manufacturer was a little unheard of then. So when the RE Amemiya team came to the circuit one day, it was a move that few expected. But what happened that day is something that only the team had really anticipated for. In 1987, RE Amemiya became legend for setting one of the fastest time records that Yatabe has ever seen. But how? It was with the FORTIS RX-7 that magic happened. Using a combination of 13 years of Rotary engine tuning experience and carefully crafted parts (a majority of which were created by RE Amemiya themselves) the car had its power output increased to 440PS. And so it was on that fateful day that the fast yet stable FORTIS RX-7 was able to hit a top speed of 315.1km/h, a record in Yatabe for both rotary and non-rotary cars alike. Extremely proud of the results, RE-Amemiya participated in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon, where the car won a grand prize in the auto salon's tuned car division.\\n Because of the FORTIS RX-7's success on both the track and the show, RE Amemiya decided to revamp her for the following year, strengthening her in both aspects. 1988 turned out to be both a good year and a bad year for the car, as though the FORTIS RX-7 failed to set any new records in \\n Yatabe, the car won the Tudor Card Excellence Award in that year's Tokyo Auto Salon.  It was in 1988 where the trail ended though.  The last records that I could find for the car was from that year, and then the following year in 1989, the trail goes cold. Nobody knows the whereabouts of the car, and even those who were possibly actively searching then most likely came up empty-handed. In fact, aside from a single page that showcases the car's spec list and its achievements, RE Amemiya seems to have mostly forgotten about the car, especially in light with their later tuning achievements like the Super GT GT300 RX7. If it weren't for a certain Japanese Tuner Magazine's video, I probably wouldn't have even knew that this ever existed!  But here it is. I don't know how I found it, but I sure am glad I am to be able to share this forgotten piece of history with you guys. Just looking at the pics made me realize that the car would still look dope even today. Enjoy!

Thank yooooou!\\n\\nSubmitted: November 18, 2018 5', '#ADMUFreedomWall16619\\n\\nThis is my opinion but I think that an underlying problem with ADMU is that it discourages its students from walking around, given how certain important buildings like Bellarmine Hall and ISO are located FAR AWAY from where most of the Loyola School (LS) buildings are clustered. Meanwhile the really niche buildings like PIPAC, the freshman dorm halls (Cervini/Eliazo), and even the ASOG are located closer to LS. It\\'s why students complain a lot about their BEL-CTC scheds and you can\\'t blame them since they were probably batch 2 and were forced to pick those BEL classes next to their CTC classes. In any case, it still doesn\\'t take away my point that the way ADMU has been planned has been quite crap. Instead of devoting so much money on creating more and maintaining existing parking spaces and encouraging students to bring their cars, they should\\'ve just focus on relocating the important buildings like cafeterias and BEL/FA ANNEX buildings closer to the LS area. This would\\'ve perhaps lead students to rely less on their cars, which will eventually reduce the need for parking spaces, and use those other remaining spaces as ports for trikes and other public transpo. That way, that remaining space will take up even less space compared to the already existing parking spaces. Even so, it would also help create more space for more trees = more shade = relatively cooler campus. At the very least I do hope they could at least make their existing buildings more \"green\" (though I\\'m not saying that in a Lasallian way). I mean, allowing vertical gardens to be a thing in the existing building clusters like Leong Hall, Rizal Libs, Soc Sci, De La Costa, etc.  Regardless, what Ateneo should be doing is making its campus even more pedestrian friendly, since in all honesty, it\\'s one of the best campuses to stroll around.  Thus, making it more \"walkable\" will perhaps help ease out the traffic outside Katipunan. #UrbanPlanningADMU  Submitted:  November 18, 2018 5:42:52 PM +08', '#ADMUFreedomWall16618\\n\\nI understand that for the past 3 years, many of us have mocked \"Ang Probinsyano\" for being too \"pang-masa\" and treated it as a lower form of entertainment, when we fail to recognize that the show is still a form of art that reflects the current human condition, and its depiction of the police force is only a reaction of the present.

Well I have been feeling like that kanina while I was being used for printing and cutting out business cards. It was around 10am when my brother asked me to print out 17 sheets of business cards (9 per sheet) on a short bond paper ole he was at a bazaar. So I printed 10 sheets on a wrong paper since it was too thin. Then, I printed another 17 on another paper that’s somewhat thicker, spent my time cutting then according to those outlines of the cards, and arranging in an orderly manner. (Of course I didn’t cut them all yet since I also had to work on my deliverable for my major) When he arrived home, he saw that I was cutting and stacking them. He was glad until my mom pointed out that the paper I used was too thin for a business card. I’m a college undergrad and I don’t have an internship yet so don’t expect me to find a specific kind of paper for that. Another is that he didn’t mention what kind of short bond paper he wanted me to use (carboard paper) so I have nothing to be ashamed of. Seriously, galit na ako ah and I have other things to do other than your pathetic business cards. I was really planning to do a report and my project deliverable on the same day. I’m tired na and I don’t want to cram UGH. If you would have told me the night before, I would set my time to do it. But now, it’s like I don’t want to help you anymore.

Para sa akin kasi kailangan mo ipractice nang ipractice ang Filipino kasi kung matagal mo na siyang hindi nagagamit sa tingin mo ba yung galing mo sa pagsalita ng Filipino noon parehas pa rin ba siya pagkatapos ng matagal na panahon ng hindi mo paggamit nito? Parang math lang yan, hindi porket napag-aralan mo na siya noon, maalala mo na agad kung paano mo isolve ang isang problem after ng ilang yrs na hindi mo paggamit nito. [Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino.

Kung hindi naman mapapalalim ang kaalaman natin tungkol sa wika natin, paano tayo magiging matagumpay sa pagtulong ng mga taong nasa mga laylayan? Alam mo ba na may mga batas nga na para sa mga kasambahay, magsasaka, atbp. pero halos lahat naman ng mga taong kabilang sa dito, wala naman gaanong alam tungkol dito kasi naka-English yung batas natin.

So ayun, hindi ko alam kung napakita ko ba yung kahalagahan ng pag-aral nito kahit sa kolehiyo haha sana makuha kahit konti lang hindi ako magaling makipagdebate tungkol sa isyu na ito nakakatrigger ka lang (sinubukan ko rin maging purong Filipino yung sasabihin ko dito, pero kita mo naman di ba haha sana marealize mo yun hehe peace!)

I find it very convenient to be able to help in finding parking but this gives more people a reason to bring a car. Now all of us who usually bring a car and live far away have to fight even worse for parking spots in the school. Moreover, actually having a means to enable lot reservation through whatever means may lead a chance to having other people’s cars stay longer just so that their friend or whoever they are messaging to be able to take the spot after them (hopefully people are better than this). I do strongly encourage not to add a lot reservation scheme because the parking will be full at all times especially at peak hours if many people will be using the app.  Anyways best of wishes on the app development. Thanks for reading.

I am falling for you. How can I not? You have the most perfect face. You are f*king handsome. You are smart, You are responsible. You are funny. You are decent. You have so many girls crushing on you but you don't care about them. You are ambitious. You are everything good and I respect you. As your best friend, I am lucky to be the person you hug, you hold hands with, you send selfies to, you share food with, you wait for, you reserve a seat for, you offer your shoulder to sleep on... Sometimes, i wonder, do you like me? If so, are these the signals? Are you waiting for me to affirm this?  But i really don't know. Coz when we aren't in school, you rarely call or text. I know you said that you aren't ready for any relationship yet but you know, i can wait. But i wanna know if my wait is going to be worthwhile. When you told me not to leave you ever and I said yes, i really meant it. YOu said you were kilig and I wonder what that meant? Is this purely friendship? Coz you know i really like you and i wished that you would give me hints if you like me. Just so as you know, not all chinese girls have the great wall. If that's what is stopping you. And even if there was a great wall for me, I know that you are someone my parents will surely accept. I know i'm not the prettiest girl, i'm sure you have prettier ones waiting in line. I'm not the smartest either, you know that.  Am I too ambitious? Well, you know it's really hard to be pretending all the time.  When you hold my hand, i want to lock it in mine forever. When you hug me, i want to stay that way forever. When you say don't leave me, i wanted to tell you I will be here forever.... #ME freshie in love with bestfriend Submitted:  November 13, 2018 4:50:01 PM +08\", \"#ADMUFreedomWall16166\\n\\nI'm desperate so: to whoever found my blue pencil case (for specifics, content includes usb, 3 colored highlighters and some index cards) please comment down huhuhuhu :((( been going to lost and found and it still hasn't been reported :(((\\n\\nSubmitted: November 13, 2018 2\", '#ADMUFreedomWall16159\\n\\nkapag busted ka ni crush, sabi sayo \"shit ka kasi\"\\n.\\nkailangan balikan mo \"at least free na ako sa butas ng pwet mo la ka pang ano eh\"\\n .

Like seriously, my father expects me to talk about something that makes my family feel entertained. It makes me feel like I am forced to come up with a presentation every time my family and I are seated together. Look, I am not like my brother at all who talks about anything. I understand the advantages of talking with people but I rather be alone so I can be in peace (I really hate noise). I tend to be social sometimes, especially when I’m with my friends, but I WILL NOT CHANGE MYSELF FROM BEING AN INTROVERT. No matter how many times you have been asking regarding my personality, don’t hope for a change, dad. It’s really disgusting and I really can’t do that because it’s unhealthy for me. Plus, I am not allowing myself to make the same mistake I had done to my (b*chy 🖕🏻) friend three years ago and it hurts for me to express things wrongly. 🎮🎮 Submitted:  November 11, 2018 10:33:02 PM +08', \"#ADMUFreedomWall16044\\n\\nHey Blue Babble\\n\\nSince there's a 4-Bass Drum rule, why don't you guys use the A-M-D-G drums?

I mean gets, you can google the summary of the topic or something, but bitch was just GOOGLING EVERYTHING - even the tagline or motto or anything we had to put in the docs. The worst part was our group didn\\'t know each other, and she was the most vocal one. So when we started suggesting things, and everyone was agreeing except her. She was just like, \"uhh i don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea *GOOGLES* i think this is a better idea! *shows vague article*\" and every time someone suggested something, she kept turning it down. That person knew she had little knowledge about the topic that\\'s why she was googling, and people who were more informed about it were shelling out good ideas. But since people weren\\'t close with each other and she was the most vocal one, she just turned down everyone\\'s ideas by pointing out whats wrong with it and how those ideas were a \"hassle.\" Wala lang I\\'m from SOM also but sometimes, after 4 years in Ateneo, I still get amazed at how people in this school (JGSOM) lack sooooo much creativity. That there literally are people who try to rely on google for every single thing. I don\\'t know if sigurista lang sila because they don\\'t want to make mistakes, but seriously it wouldn\\'t hurt to think outside the box sometimes.

Just recently, I managed to get my guy to help me climb it. I regret it.\\n\\nContext: I had been seeing this guy for almost an entire year. We told each other we were in love with the other, but for an entire year he refused to tell his parents about how he felt towards me. In a turn of events, he finally did.  His mother and father were a lot more bigoted than I thought. They threatened to stop paying for his education. They cried. They acted as if he was throwing his future away, and kept on insisting that even if I was \"a nice girl,\" my family was the one he should be wary of. His dad even mentioned that marrying a Filipina was a death sentence for any reasonable, successful businessman because no one wanted to do business with someone who had the audacity to marry what they generally think is an ugly gold digger.  I felt angry. Not only were they disrespecting me, they were disrespecting my family. My mom and dad hold masters degrees/PhDs and were academic and financial scholars respectively. They have made a respectable living out of their jobs and have even been expatriated in the past. His parents have no right to generalize that we\\'re so money hungry and classless that I\\'d go for their eldest son in order to sustain us. It made me realize that all the agony and kasawian we go through in trying to \"climb the great wall\" is degrading and useless. If you respect yourself enough, don\\'t grovel at their feet. Don\\'t give them that power.  I love him, yes, but I love myself too. It took me a year to find that love and self-respect to just accept it\\'s not going to happen. The best you can do is change this generation\\'s mind about Filipino-Chinese relationships, but don\\'t bet on it that you\\'ll get your own happy ending in this one.

I have good grades naman and I'm not the type who'll be 'pariwara' or something like that. I'm not that stupid, and I really value my acads.  I came across this tweet and I relate so much to it. It's true what they say na 'strict parents raise the best liars.' I still manage to sneak out and party every now and then. I have a solid group of friends who always cover for me. They understand my situation and they want me to have some fun din naman. I noticed that the kids with stricter parents are the ones who become the wildest pa nga sa mga parties. They want to seize every opportunity they get to go out kasi so they end up getting wasted talaga or really promiscous.  Dear parents, you're not doing your kids a favor by being outright controlling. If you constantly invade their privacy, they're just going to rebel and resent you forever for it. It'll just strain your relationship with your child, and they wouldn't be comfortable talking about what's going on in their lives with you anymore. If you have concerns with them drinking or having sexual relations then talk to them about it. Go set boundaries and explain your concerns, but don't forget to listen to your child's side din. We're not little kids anymore, we know what's right and wrong. We can look after ourselves if only you let us.

But once I reached the forest, I knew there was something wrong. The hair on my arms stood up as I surveyed the unnaturally dark surrounding. I noticed that it was too quiet, as if the whole forest was holding its breath. Despite this, I braved on, determined to get home. And anyways, it was just a short path. What was the worst that could happen, right? As I walked, the post about the Rendezvous Girl popped in my head. I shrugged the thoughts away — it was just another silly story for scaring people. Also, I\\'m a girl. I was sure that the offer of \"free head\" wouldn\\'t apply to me.  In the distance, I could already see the lights from the covered pathway. With newfound courage (and a bit of smugness), I jokingly whispered \"Rendezvous\". As the word escaped my lips, a chill emitted from behind me. Every cell in my body was shouting for me to run, but I turned around anyway.  That\\'s when I saw him. The first thing I noticed was the paper bag on his head. Up to now, the crudely drawn smiley is still branded in my memory. My eyes went down, trailing over his naked and grimy body, until they settled over a smaller paper bag, with a similar smiley, covering his nether region. In another situation, I would have found it funny, but at that moment, all I felt was fear.  He tilted his head to the side and curled his index finger two times, a summon for me to draw nearer. I can\\'t explain it, but I took a step toward him. I was only 5 feet away when the lower paper bag fell off. A scream formed in the back of my throat as I saw the mangled and rotting remains of his phallus. A thick fetid gooey liquid was spurting out, and maggots were crawling through holes in the skin. I finally ran, the fastest that I\\'ve ever ran in my life, all the way to Gate 2.5, then all the way home.  But what happened in SOM forest stayed with me. Every night, I dream of Rendezvous Guy. Every night, he beckons me to come back. And every night, I feel myself slowly giving in. Submitted:  September 30, 2018 12:52:20 PM +08', '#ADMUFreedomWall9970\\n\\nMinimum wage must be abolished.

Borderline suicidal already and stuff but what really encouraged me and made me smile despite the pain was when I got on the phone with my sister in the CR in SEC B then I guess the Ate overheard my conversation. She locked the door for me which, at first I didn't notice, but then she even encouraged me after the phone call to talk to someone if I need help and to go to the guidance office and stuff.\\n\\nI guess, in many ways, I regret that I only realized many minutes later that I should've asked for her name. My point is, love is everywhere. It was the kind of unexpected love that really threw me off guard and made me smile despite my overflowing family problems. Life is tough even for the toughest, most indestructible cookie (like I thought I was) but giving love, even to people you don't know, is important. ALSO notice the Ates at school, even those who aren't Ate Alma. They're people, too, and they deserve to be loved as much as we do.

If anything, I generally see anyone bandying around comments like \"haha 3guarD sjw cuckés\" as someone unwilling to engage ideas head-on and get to the bottom of things. - Nobody is apolitical. Everything is political. Lines are drawn every time someone declares himself a \"neutral party\" to an issue. More often than not, neutrality is rooted in the belief that you have no stake in the issue, that it isn\\'t important enough from your point of view to care. But for the labor-only contractual worker, the knife of unemployment, poverty, and hunger is constantly cold on his neck. It matters to him, and it matters to anyone who would dare demand a better world from powers-that-be. - Being 3dGy really doesn\\'t cut it. It\\'s not top-tier shitposting.

I don't want to be misunderstood but here ah. I get that you want to express yourself fully, that not every word used and their meanings can fully describe the complexity of your sexualities and genders but the charge to come up with more words shouldn't be a charge. It should be a slower, methodical, and well thought out process of naming.  You're running the risk of literally alienating everyone that's trying to understand. It's starting to sound like a foreign language and what's worse is the language doesn't seem to stop changing. All the new terms being added is putting me off trying to understand. I'm not saying that I'm not trying, I really am but the problem is that it isn't centralized. It's a select few members of the community that's putting in new words when others have words for it already. You can see it right? Even members of the community are getting confused already.  It's beautiful that you can express yourself! But my goodness it has to slow down and reorganize or else it'll just alienate people.

Take it from me. I met some of my closest friends from the most random classes. (Orgs too, of course, but if that's not your thing, don't feel pressured to join!)\\n Bottomline is: Don't feel the need to fit in with your block. Try to make friends outside of your block, even if that just means coursemates. And most of all, you don't have to pretend to be someone you're not!

They're B-Mirk Enterprise employees, they go to Nutriasia as outsourced workers (Like a call center agent doing work for a client, but is signed under the call center, not the client). Getting mad at Nutriasia is like getting mad at the call center's client because the client refuses to (and tbh, they shouldn't) give the call center employees benefits that they aren't entitled to anyway. Since you know... the workers are not the client's employees, they're the call center's... It's B-Mirk's job to ensure that the employees are enjoying benefits from them and are paid well, not Nutriasia. 2nd, the police were the one who beat them up, not Nutriasia.  So why is the hate targeted towards Nutriasia when it should be towards B-Mirk Enterprise and the police? The only sin of Nutriasia here is picking a bad labor provider, nothing more really.

In that moment of peacefulness, you get flashbacks of all the memories you've made in this place and you think about how much you'll miss them once you'll leave. It makes you sad but it also makes you want to cherish the time you have left in here. You think of the people you'd want to have lunch with or org events you wouldn't want to miss. And after that, I guess all that's left is to go do it and make the most out of it. ❤\\n\\nSubmitted: September 25, 2018 7\", '#ADMUFreedomWall8707\\n\\nm o o d\\n\\nSubmitted: September 25, 2018 7', '#ADMUFreedomWall8701\\n\\nNote: 99% of Ateneans don\\'t agree with the \"many UP students being in Regis are annoying\" post.\\n\\nBut I\\'m not here for that, this is a university rank discussion post. The tweet that became popular said that Ateneo was just a 2nd rate University compared to U.P. https://mobile.twitter.com/piodu…/status/1044147879479111680 I know it\\'s a joke tweet but it reminded  me of that age old discussion of University rankings. In the end, the general rank of your University is a far less important than the rank of your specific course. A minority of U.P students like to brag towards Ateneans, likewise a minority of Ateneans brag against DLSU and so on...but the university rankings are meaningless when you check the board exam passing rate of your specific course. The top 3 medical schools in the country aren\\'t even from the big 4. So course rank is a lot more important than school rank. Ofcourse, don\\'t forget about mental health though.
