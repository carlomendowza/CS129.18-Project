      "I feel you guys. I’m an oldie of the org I assume you are referring to and to be honest I only remained a member because a) I still somehow love my work, and b) I still have very very good friends in the org. Yes they are VERY cliquish. What completely sucks is that there is a sense of “coldness” between the cast and the production teams. Hell cast members don’t even say hi to you when you say hi to them in the theater. For fuck’s sake one time, after I’d just finished doing the show for lights, I stepped out and they told me “Thank you for watching!” as of I were part of the audience. They didn’t even know I’d been there for literally almost every show. This was done to me 4 TIMES. 4 fucking times like holy shit di niyo ba ako kilala or something I try to say hi to you people every fucking time.  To all the people who defend the org and say “Just go to HR. They’re there for a reason,” this isn’t a simple “HR” problem. There’s a problem with how the org has been systematically. There is a lot of nepotism. Some people get positions that they don’t deserve but only get because they’re friends with the PMs. For example, I once applied to be the part of a mainstage second semester production. Prior to applying, I had done 3 org productions, 3 productions for another org, and I’d even done professional work outside of Ateneo. Basically, and not to boast, I was THE ONE for the job. I didn’t get it. Instead, someone who was close with the PM and whose only experience in Technicals was working in set & props got the job. It was incredibly frustrating.  That being said, to the two newbies who have spoken out, I implore you to stay not because of the people. Stay for the craft. It can’t be denied that said org still has great productions (despite a lot of backstage frustration) and the performers are still among the best in the school and even in the Philippines. Love your work. It doesn’t mean you have to love the people along the way. Screw them.\n",

      "THIS POST WAS MADE TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT NETWORKING AND HOW FRAUDULENT THEIR REPS ARE I know it's not good to generalize but there was this brand (rhymes with MuSkeen) who invited me for a meeting about a job opening in my field. Already skeptical about it, I told them that I'll think about it. Joke's on me for worrying to come off as impolite if I say no.  When the day came that he followed up for my confirmation, I straight up asked the person if it was a network marketing event. He literally said NO THAT IT WASNT. Believing him, I went to the meeting because I trusted him. THAT'S WHERE I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.  The speakers of the event were going on about how \"Network Marketing was the best way to earn money\" UGH FUQ IVE BEEN LIED TO AND I FELL FOR IT  I'm already laughing at myself for falling for this. But I'm sharing this experience to y'all AS A CAUTIONARY TALE to avoid people messaging you about a \"business venture\" or a \"business opportunity\", take everything with a grain of salt. If they won't tell you what brand they're working for, don't waste more time entertaining these shady people. If you already think they're dodgey, trust your gut. If you can't find them on the first page of Google, don't even think about it. Network marketers/pyramid scheme scammers make people on the higher wrungs richer. They're stigmatized for a reason. All these skincare/health pharma things may be the bread and butter to some but I hope these people DONT LIE TO PEOPLE JUST SO THEY CAN GET THEIR WAY. It's not impolite to step away when you realize it's a fraudulent invitation.  That's 2.5 hours of my life that I won't get back. HOW DO THESE PEOPLE SLEEP\n",

Now I just kinda hate him because wala tangina gusto ko pa rin siya huhu. I gave up on trying to be halaman altogether, but I also kinda gave up on him at some point kasi sobrang wala kaming common friend circles at common activities except that one class we have together. And I was super obvious with him and got the feel na sinusungitan niya ako ergo di siya interested. Tapos out of nowhere kinausap niya ako after class??!?! As in I know that's nbd pero isipin mo. Isipin mo yung sobrang crush na crush mo isang tao tapos sinungitan ka nila, tapos kumbinsado ka na ayaw na ayaw nila sayo tapos biglang kakausapin ka nila?? Naku kuya mahirap yan. I'm so Maropoque™. Kaya ayan naloka ako all over again. Tumingin ulit ako sa horoscope para lang may reference ako of some sort na kung type ba ng sign niya yung girl yung magmamake ng first move?? Honestly sobrang bobo ko lang. Like, am I really gonna base my actions on his natal chart? Tbh probably but sobrang ???  Apparently his sign will try anything once, so I was kinda banking on that?? But ayun, recently, I decided okay fine- I'll ask him out. Fuck it. I'm gonna do it. What's the worst that could happen? I've been rejected several times before. I can handle it.  And I started telling people na parang okay I'm gonna do it, kahit na sobrang mukhang cannot be, susubukan ko kasi I will never know for sure. After asking for some advice, I figured sige I can build up talking to him for a few times muna after class before really asking him out, kahit one meeting lang. So ayun hinahype ko sarili ko, kakausapin ko siya after class.  Ito na. Ito na. Tapos alam mo yung sa movies, yung hahabulin na ng main character yung gusto nila tapos biglang pag nag-pan na yung camera may kasamang iba AGOYYYYYY There was a girl waiting for him na, and they walked together. And like ang sakit mga pare bro. As in feel ko naman tropa lang sila pero alam mo yung sobrang naramdaman ko lang lalo na magka-ibang mundo kami and sobrang longshot talaga. And parang he has enough girls around him, and hindi kami same crowd, so di rin ako tugma sa personality ng mga girls that he usually hangs around.  But also for some reason parang this is the third time since freshman year na I've seen this same girl with a guy I like and parang ate girl tulong how?? Tapos ex ata siya ng orsem crush ko, so wow an extra oof. Oof lang talaga.\n"

But of course where there is light, there is darkness ; it hurts when you feel no comfort from anyone. When the love of your life is no longer yours you feel like nothing matters. She doesnt even care about what you do anymore, she hurt you like you were no one to her. Also Imagine getting betrayed by your friends when you treated them like family yeah that happened to me too. I would even die for them or even help them hide a dead body if they needed me to. Everything hurts to the point you’re numb and you don’t even know yourself anymore. Sometimes you just dont know eho to trust and lean on. That is where my cigarette comes in, it comforts me whenever i feel alone and unwanted.
