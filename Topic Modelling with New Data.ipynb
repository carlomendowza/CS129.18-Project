All of them laughed except for one, she helped me and even asked if I was okay. I was so flustered and just stared at her face. She had the most amazing smile and I couldn't even utter a word. It was funny because she actually got mad at her friends for laughing at me. And as she was helping me pick up my things, she giggled, not bec\\r\\nause of me but because she also fell in those damn stairs in the library and she felt like shit when people just stared at her so she didn't want the same thing to happen to me. She had such a distinctive laugh, the best one I have ever heard so far.  She had to leave before I could even thank her and ask for her name. All I know is that she was wearing the film org lanyard. She might be an Ican because I knew some of the people she was with were from that school.  I really want to see this girl again. I have yet to thank her and I really am looking forward to personally meet someone with her kindness. If any of you know her, please tag her. Because I think I just met my soul mate.</td>\n",

Seeing this video was reminiscent to how drug cartels would summarily execute people off the streets. If people are dying left and right, and the notion of labeling their deaths as 'police self defence,' or that the victims fought back, and leaving it at that, then no one is safe to this kind of cruelty.\\r\\n Tomorrow, the very people being left to die on the streets just might be me and you. Unless of course you're of a rich and/or influential family.

       "4   I saw this girl last thursday. She was hanging out with a bunch of Icans and while I was going down the stairs, I tripped. All of them laughed except for one, she helped me and even asked if I was okay. I was so flustered and just stared at her face. She had the most amazing smile and I couldn't even utter a word. It was funny because she actually got mad at her friends for laughing at me. And as she was helping me pick up my things, she giggled, not bec\\r\\nause of me but because she also fell in those damn stairs in the library and she felt like shit when people just stared at her so she didn't want the same thing to happen to me. She had such a distinctive laugh, the best one I have ever heard so far.  She had to leave before I could even thank her and ask for her name. All I know is that she was wearing the film org lanyard. She might be an Ican because I knew some of the people she was with were from that school.  I really want to see this girl again. I have yet to thank her and I really am looking forward to personally meet someone with her kindness. If any of you know her, please tag her. Because I think I just met my soul mate.   \n",

Seeing this video was reminiscent to how drug cartels would summarily execute people off the streets. If people are dying left and right, and the notion of labeling their deaths as police self defence, or that the victims fought back, and leaving it at that, then no one is safe to this kind of cruelty. Tomorrow, the very people being left to die on the streets just might be me and you. Unless of course youre of a rich and/or influential family.

All of them laughed except for one, she helped me and even asked if I was okay. I was so flustered and just stared at her face. She had the most amazing smile and I couldnt even utter a word. It was funny because she actually got mad at her friends for laughing at me. And as she was helping me pick up my things, she giggled, not bec ause of me but because she also fell in those damn stairs in the library and she felt like shit when people just stared at her so she didnt want the same thing to happen to me. She had such a distinctive laugh, the best one I have ever heard so far. She had to leave before I could even thank her and ask for her name. All I know is that she was wearing the film org lanyard. She might be an Ican because I knew some of the people she was with were from that school. I really want to see this girl again. I have yet to thank her and I really am looking forward to personally meet someone with her kindness. If any of you know her, please tag her. Because I think I just met my soul mate.</td>\n",

I get that Coco might think that people will end up ordering anyway because Coco, but this is not sustainable at all. So many of us have stopped buying from Coco already because of the ridiculous waiting times, and were surely not the last ones to renounce it. At the end of the day, all this waiting is just not worth it. We spend 45 minutes to an hour in line just for a drink thats more milk than it is tea. For shame, Coco.

Am I supposed to be worrying/paranoid about this? Its just every time we meet it doesnt seem the most fruitful. FYI: Im not suspecting him of cheating Im just maybe bored or unenthusiastic with whats happening.</td>\n",

They dont dislike me but they dont particularly like me either. Some of my classmates i enjoy spending time with, but we only really spend time together in class. Most of the time theyd rather go with their other friends after class. This is probably the worst kind of loneliness. The one where Im surrounded by people and yet i still feel alone. I meet so many new people but for some reason i still feel alone. I try and try to become closer to them but its like no matter how hard i try to reach out, theyre just too high for me to reach. At this point, im tired of trying and maybe ill just accept this lonely life of mine. Hopefully theres more in store for next sem.</td>\n",

However, I fear more on what happens after this semester. I may not be of importance, yet Ateneo needs a lot of bug fixes. A LOT. Lots of issues have been ranted already The Covered Courts parking. UAAP tickets fiasco. The old Residence Halls. Scientific equipment. Are they still be left to rot? I doubt theyd be upgraded. The bureaucracys still up there. And from the lessons of my last roleplay... The power of the institution is from the students per se. We need more than just talking to the admin about this.

       "3     https://www.facebook.com/braveyawtz/videos/1744836578868329/ Its crazy to realize how much all the attention on the war on drugs has died down. Seeing this video was reminiscent to how drug cartels would summarily execute people off the streets. If people are dying left and right, and the notion of labeling their deaths as police self defence, or that the victims fought back, and leaving it at that, then no one is safe to this kind of cruelty. Tomorrow, the very people being left to die on the streets just might be me and you. Unless of course youre of a rich and/or influential family. Move along, I guess this shouldnt concern you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4     I saw this girl last thursday. She was hanging out with a bunch of Icans and while I was going down the stairs, I tripped. All of them laughed except for one, she helped me and even asked if I was okay. I was so flustered and just stared at her face. She had the most amazing smile and I couldnt even utter a word. It was funny because she actually got mad at her friends for laughing at me. And as she was helping me pick up my things, she giggled, not bec ause of me but because she also fell in those damn stairs in the library and she felt like shit when people just stared at her so she didnt want the same thing to happen to me. She had such a distinctive laugh, the best one I have ever heard so far. She had to leave before I could even thank her and ask for her name. All I know is that she was wearing the film org lanyard. She might be an Ican because I knew some of the people she was with were from that school. I really want to see this girl again. I have yet to thank her and I really am looking forward to personally meet someone with her kindness. If any of you know her, please tag her. Because I think I just met my soul mate.                                                                \n",

       "12    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PItbZklYYNQ The last song we listened to on the radio, that late night you sent me back home. This is probably the last in this year that were going to meet. And well meet not-so-rarely, because at one point you always will, even in the next year. Probably, or probably not. You were very random, like that. I have too many sad memories for a lot of songs, but this one I will associate with you with a lot of happiness. Because happiness is what you are, and what I always liked you for, despite all that happens to you. Also: I wish it would have been us, but Im not even sad, because pain is not what you have brought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "13    Ok so inactive ang ADMU Crushes pero hindi ko na talaga kaya. Kailangan ko na talaga mailabas. Miguel, I like you a lot. Youre the reason why I join our study groups, even if its 4 hours past my bedtime. Youre the reason why I keep going out with our block. Youre the reason why I stay in the room even after the bell rings, hoping I would get to walk home with you. I like you so much, but Im scared to tell you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "16    Honestly? Cocos service is garbage. Even at the height of the milk tea craze, lines were never this long and getting your drink didnt have to take an hour. And the classic places like Gong Cha and Serenitea had as many employees as usual Coco branches have today, so I dont get what the problem is. And I dont even know why Coco takes forever to serve customers. If they know they have a queuing problem, why the hell arent they opening more lines? Why dont their new branches have more lines? I get that Coco might think that people will end up ordering anyway because Coco, but this is not sustainable at all. So many of us have stopped buying from Coco already because of the ridiculous waiting times, and were surely not the last ones to renounce it. At the end of the day, all this waiting is just not worth it. We spend 45 minutes to an hour in line just for a drink thats more milk than it is tea. For shame, Coco. You better shape up, or everyone else is gonna eventually get sick of your bullshit.                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "1039  I dont know if Im overthinking this or not, but Im kind of bummed out with my relationship with my boyfriend. Its because it feels like we dont really talk or communicate despite the three years weve been together already. If ever we do see each other, all wed do is have sex, sleep, or use our phones. From the first day we met, we were pretty chatty, but then Im not sure what happened. I think Ive hinted enough about this and maybe even told him, b ut the same things just keep repeating. Am I supposed to be worrying/paranoid about this? Its just every time we meet it doesnt seem the most fruitful. FYI: Im not suspecting him of cheating Im just maybe bored or unenthusiastic with whats happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1048  #FWhelp Is it really possible to find a best friend or barkada in Ateneo when: 1. everyone (around you) has heavy workload (if acads are easy for them, they still fill it up to the brim with org work and other activities) 2. when majority of people (around you) are no longer looking for that BFF or barkada because they already found them 3. when you have lower than average social skills Im graduating. I have had no luck. The only thing good that happened to me regarding this topic is that my social skills have really improved and I meet more people. But I just wonder when I will ever feel like I belong somewhere. I know I can do this after grad, but I just want to know if theres anything I can still do before graduating.

       "1056  TL;DR Im lonely Ever since i entered college, never have i ever felt so lonely in my life. I had high hopes of starting fresh and making new friends/barkadas when i entered college but those hopes have died. My block is too divided and the worst part is im in the division. They dont dislike me but they dont particularly like me either. Some of my classmates i enjoy spending time with, but we only really spend time together in class. Most of the time theyd rather go with their other friends after class. This is probably the worst kind of loneliness. The one where Im surrounded by people and yet i still feel alone. I meet so many new people but for some reason i still feel alone. I try and try to become closer to them but its like no matter how hard i try to reach out, theyre just too high for me to reach. At this point, im tired of trying and maybe ill just accept this lonely life of mine. Hopefully theres more in store for next sem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1057  #RBateneo Hi! I am among the supporting admins of the first RantBox. If you know the person that had just had his account down, you probably know who he is. I am speaking here right now. Okay. I would probably be not be an active admin anymore, because I had my account down because of a RantBox post that made FB be a basis for its deletion. I...am now scared that this might happen to the newer version. I am speaking from another account, as of the moment. I had to, since not doing this would not make me keep updated with academics. However, I fear more on what happens after this semester. I may not be of importance, yet Ateneo needs a lot of bug fixes. A LOT. Lots of issues have been ranted already The Covered Courts parking. UAAP tickets fiasco. The old Residence Halls. Scientific equipment. Are they still be left to rot? I doubt theyd be upgraded. The bureaucracys still up there. And from the lessons of my last roleplay... The power of the institution is from the students per se. We need more than just talking to the admin about this. We need to make sure the admin is constantly caring for their source of power: us students. That is our job, aside from studying and getting that diploma.  \n",

       "1059  Right now, I feel disturbed by the rise of Communist-sympathetic groups and Communist-sympathizers. I wish they would realize that the CPP-NPA is only using them to gain power and there are better ways of addressing the problems in Philippine society. I understand that there is a Communist insurrection due to age-old problems in Philippine society, but armed rebellion is no way to solve them. Also, I agree with President Duterte, despite being against a lot of his policies and the persecutions of opposition members, that a coalition government is not a good thing, for coalitions were used by Communist parties to take over, just like what happened in Eastern Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1063  I dont think the original Rantbox was shitty. I thought it was pretty woke but the people submitting on it just started abusing the anonymity of the page. It was a good idea for them to close down the page, creating this page totally defeats the purpose of the first page closing it down.

Of course nothing is going to change because people can have Coco wherever they are, and Coco is earning so much more because the number of customers has skyrocketed. But Ive been going to Regis Coco because I love the place and I love hanging out with friends over there. It was a nice place to relax and have a good time. The ambiance was lively but not exhausting. It was homely but not boring. I have had wonderful memories in every seat, and have had laughs with some of the employees even. But the Grab drivers just ruin it. The line is so long, I could stand in line for 30 minutes. Even when I do get to order, I could wait an hour in my seat before I get my drink. Why? Because there are 10 Grab drivers, each ordering multiple drinks. Coco wasnt always like this. Of course there was usually a line, and of course there was always a wait time. But in the past few months, the lines have gotten unbearably long, and the waiting time has become ridiculous. Customers who still go there in-person suffer. There are chairs and table there because its also a sit-down place; part of Coco is the store, not just the drink. Its not just a hole in the wall that pumps out drinks to people. Im letting out my frustrations, but I know nothings gonna change. In fact, it could get even worse. Cocos earning, Grab drivers will have a consistent source of income, and people are comfortable having the Coco come to them. But for someone who has loved Coco for years, with part of that experience coming from sitting in the store and enjoying a few hours IN the physical store of Coco, I miss those days. I wish those days would come back, but I should know better. The old Coco is dead.</td>\n",

In the end, the general rank of your University is a far less important than the rank of your specific course. A minority of U.P students like to brag towards Ateneans, likewise a minority of Ateneans brag against DLSU and so on...but the university rankings are meaningless when you check the board exam passing rate of your specific course. The top 3 medical schools in the country arent even from the big 4. So course rank is a lot more important than school rank. Ofcourse, dont forget about mental health though.</td>\n",

This is unsolicited advice to seek legal advice to rape victims like in  The guidance, sanggu or ADSA may or may not represent your interests, but your lawyer would. The guidance, sanggu or ADSA might (we wont really know for sure until AFTER THE FACT) be more interested in bringing the rapist to justice than giving you justice. You might think these two concepts \"bringing the perpetrator to justice\" and \"giving the victim justice\" are identical. If they are, then you can ignore this post. See 13 Reasons Why or any legal drama where rape victims are cross-examined furiously by defense attorneys. (For non-fictional examples, I wouldnt know of any that are relevant or relatable to non-lawyers. Lets hope 13 Reasons Why or those legal dramas are as realistic as they need to be here for this purpose) Prosecuting rapists is hard because our society values of privacy over security and allows defense attorneys to embarrass rape victims in court. Is Kevin Spacey or Charlie Rose in jail? Oh, did you forget that you might have to testify especially that you might not have a rape kit? This is not meant to show you there is no hope. This is meant to show you there might be some dangers without first seeking legal advice. Let me emphasize that this is not legal advice. This might not even be (good) advice on seeking legal advice.

I really love the step-down chord progression na medyo nagiging uso narin now (which iirc is actually a pretty old chord progression, like 70s or 80s nandun na siya, medyo 2000s lang sumikat ung I-IV-V chord progression). What really annoys me, is the Dsus2 part. Like, youre already going down the note na. From E-&gt; Emaj7 -&gt; E7 -&gt; E6 -&gt; A. Tapos babalik ka agad pataas with a Dsus2 e hindi ka pa nga nakakarating sa pupuntahan mo??? &gt;_&gt; Leave it at the end going back to E para mas fulfilling and sulit ung trip down. Guys try niyo. Instead of Dsus2, try a simple Am chord after A. It sounds at least 67.3% better than using Dsus2, without necessarily making the song a bit darker. If any Twice fans here can play the guitar or piano, let me know what you think hehe E Emaj7 Naega ireokedo igijeogieotdeonga E7 E6 A Mwonga ireoke gatgo sipdeon jeok isseonna, isseonna Am E Da nolla, da nolla, nae ppeonppeonhame E C D (Come on and tell me yes) P.S.

       "      <td>gusto ko lang sana sagutin yung taong to kung sino ka man 1. Para sa akin kasi requirement pa rin dapat ang Filipino. Ito ay dahil kahit na paulit-ulit na nating pinag-aaralan yan, kailangan pa rin nating isanay ang ating mga sarili sa paggamit nito nang tama na tipong magsisilbi siyang paraan para mas maintindihan ka ng mga ibang tao lalo na sa mga taong wala namang background sa English. 2. Para sa akin kasi kailangan mo ipractice nang ipractice ang See Translation Filipino kasi kung matagal mo na siyang hindi nagagamit sa tingin mo ba yung galing mo sa pagsalita ng Filipino noon parehas pa rin ba siya pagkatapos ng matagal na panahon ng hindi mo paggamit nito? Parang math lang yan, hindi porket napag-aralan mo na siya noon, maalala mo na agad kung paano mo isolve ang isang problem after ng ilang yrs na hindi mo paggamit nito. [Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino. Siya na rin mismo nagsabi na nakalimutan na rin niya paano yung mga balarila sa Filipino. (May ganun talagang case believe it or not meng)] 3. Para kanino ba tayo? (Medyo pareho lang punto ko dito at sa 1) Hindi ba ito nakakalungkot? Para sa akin, kaya natin ito ginagawa kasi para makapagsilbi tayo sa mga taong wala namang oportunidad. Hindi ba kaya may wika kasi para mas magkaroon ng maayos na komunikasyon sa mga tao? Kung hindi naman mapapalalim ang kaalaman natin tungkol sa wika natin, paano tayo magiging matagumpay sa pagtulong ng mga taong nasa mga laylayan? Alam mo ba na may mga batas nga na para sa mga kasambahay, magsasaka, atbp. pero halos lahat naman ng mga taong kabilang sa dito, wala naman gaanong alam tungkol dito kasi naka-English yung batas natin. Hindi pa nila maintindihan. Yung layunin na makapagpaalam sa mga taong makikinabang sana sa mga ito, wala na agad dahil doon. So ayun, hindi ko alam kung napakita ko ba yung kahalagahan ng pag-aral nito kahit sa kolehiyo haha sana makuha kahit konti lang hindi ako magaling makipagdebate tungkol sa isyu na ito nakakatrigger ka lang (sinubukan ko rin maging purong Filipino yung sasabihin ko dito, pero kita mo naman di ba haha sana marealize mo yun hehe peace!)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Why do people get mad at the fact that basketball is the most popular sport in the country? They mention how we should just focus on sports like billiards and football or some other height appropriate game. They say that basketball programs should be defunded and that we should literally just play for the medals. Heres the reality. You arent going to convince any young basketball player to play football by defunding basketball programs. These people pl ay basketball because its an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because its what they want, its what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids arent playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country wont produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldnt even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but Id rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they dont give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball wont turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you cant convince a person who loves Kyrie Irvings insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal. A gold medal which he doesnt give a shit about, a medal only there so that Filipinos can brag about being Filipinos.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 Z-tune is regarded as one of NISMOs finest creations to date! As a tribute to the rich history of the Skyline GT-R (which ended in 2002), NISMO purchased 18 used R34 GT-R V-specs, all of which were to be reworked by the company into one of its most impressive creations to date. NISMO extensively rebuilt the cars stock RB26 engine, by replacing virtually all of the engines original components with variants used by NISMO for their race cars. Special race-car engine treatment like balancing and boring and stroking were done to the RB, increasing its displacement to 2.8L. Even the turbos werent spared, as the ones used by the normal V-spec were replaced with IHI turbos that were set to 1.5 boost. With the engine being complimented by the replaced intercooler and exhaust system, the Z-tune is capable of producing 510hp! The rest of the car was also given a meticulous makeover by NISMO. The cars ability to handle the horses without slip was improved by the utilization of both a twin-plate clutch and an LSD. Parts that were located towards the front of the car such as the front bumper, strut bar, and hood were replaced with carbon fiber variants so as to reduce the weight of the front half of the car. A lot of these CF parts were even spot welded by NISMO to improve the rigidity of the chassis! To lessen body-roll and improve handling, NISMO also replaced the stock V-spec springs with stiffer adjustable ones and adjusted them, giving the car a stiffer suspension, not too good for the streets, but perfect for the track. Special Brembo brakes ensured that the Z-tune had better braking performance, while downforce was improved by the addition of a front splitter and a change of rear spoiler, increasing both front and rear downforce respectively. All of these improvements are not all for show though: The Z-tune was able to set an insane Tsukuba lap time of 1:01, making it the 4th fastest road-legal production car on the track! Nissan originally planned to create 19 examples of this beast, but they ended up producing only 18 Ztunes. This low number of production,combined with this car being a good showcase of NISMOs tuning capabilities, drives the prices of the R34 Z-tune extremely high. From its original selling price of only 17 million yen when new (around $100k), the current selling price of these cars are now in excess of $500k (this particular example selling for $510k!) Sadly, this very high value makes it a collectors item today, which is why youre more likely to find the car now in some rich guys climate-controlled garage instead of the tracks where this beast truly belongs.</td>\n",

       "0  You know Im honestly so frustrated about Grab Coco. I miss Regis Coco before it was just overflowing with Grab Drivers. Of course nothing is going to change because people can have Coco wherever they are, and Coco is earning so much more because the number of customers has skyrocketed. But Ive been going to Regis Coco because I love the place and I love hanging out with friends over there. It was a nice place to relax and have a good time. The ambiance was lively but not exhausting. It was homely but not boring. I have had wonderful memories in every seat, and have had laughs with some of the employees even. But the Grab drivers just ruin it. The line is so long, I could stand in line for 30 minutes. Even when I do get to order, I could wait an hour in my seat before I get my drink. Why? Because there are 10 Grab drivers, each ordering multiple drinks. Coco wasnt always like this. Of course there was usually a line, and of course there was always a wait time. But in the past few months, the lines have gotten unbearably long, and the waiting time has become ridiculous. Customers who still go there in-person suffer. There are chairs and table there because its also a sit-down place; part of Coco is the store, not just the drink. Its not just a hole in the wall that pumps out drinks to people. Im letting out my frustrations, but I know nothings gonna change. In fact, it could get even worse. Cocos earning, Grab drivers will have a consistent source of income, and people are comfortable having the Coco come to them. But for someone who has loved Coco for years, with part of that experience coming from sitting in the store and enjoying a few hours IN the physical store of Coco, I miss those days. I wish those days would come back, but I should know better. The old Coco is dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1  Note: 99% of Ateneans dont agree with the \"many UP students being in Regis are annoying\" post. But Im not here for that, this is a university rank discussion post. The tweet that became popular said that Ateneo was just a 2nd rate University compared to U.P. https://mobile.twitter.com/piodu‚Ä¶/status/1044147879479111680 I know its a joke tweet but it reminded me of that age old discussion of University rankings. In the end, the general rank of your University is a far less important than the rank of your specific course. A minority of U.P students like to brag towards Ateneans, likewise a minority of Ateneans brag against DLSU and so on...but the university rankings are meaningless when you check the board exam passing rate of your specific course. The top 3 medical schools in the country arent even from the big 4. So course rank is a lot more important than school rank. Ofcourse, dont forget about mental health though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2  Dont just go to guidance, sanggu or ADSA right away. Talk to a lawyer first. This is unsolicited advice to seek legal advice to rape victims like in  The guidance, sanggu or ADSA may or may not represent your interests, but your lawyer would. The guidance, sanggu or ADSA might (we wont really know for sure until AFTER THE FACT) be more interested in bringing the rapist to justice than giving you justice. You might think these two concepts \"bringing the perpetrator to justice\" and \"giving the victim justice\" are identical. If they are, then you can ignore this post. See 13 Reasons Why or any legal drama where rape victims are cross-examined furiously by defense attorneys. (For non-fictional examples, I wouldnt know of any that are relevant or relatable to non-lawyers. Lets hope 13 Reasons Why or those legal dramas are as realistic as they need to be here for this purpose) Prosecuting rapists is hard because our society values of privacy over security and allows defense attorneys to embarrass rape victims in court. Is Kevin Spacey or Charlie Rose in jail? Oh, did you forget that you might have to testify especially that you might not have a rape kit? This is not meant to show you there is no hope. This is meant to show you there might be some dangers without first seeking legal advice. Let me emphasize that this is not legal advice. This might not even be (good) advice on seeking legal advice. This is advice that you should seek legal advice!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "4  This is the only place I can post this kasi Im a bit of a closet kpop fan. Anyways, I really like Twices song Yes or Yes. PERO!!! Naiinis ako sa chord progression ng verse. This is the original (taken from ultimate-guitar) E Emaj7 Naega ireokedo igijeogieotdeonga E7 E6 A Mwonga ireoke gatgo sipdeon jeok isseonna, isseonna Dsus2 E Da nolla, da nolla, nae ppeonppeonhame E C D (Come on and tell me yes) Now in general ok naman siya. I really love the step-down chord progression na medyo nagiging uso narin now (which iirc is actually a pretty old chord progression, like 70s or 80s nandun na siya, medyo 2000s lang sumikat ung I-IV-V chord progression). What really annoys me, is the Dsus2 part. Like, youre already going down the note na. From E-> Emaj7 -> E7 -> E6 -> A. Tapos babalik ka agad pataas with a Dsus2 e hindi ka pa nga nakakarating sa pupuntahan mo??? >_> Leave it at the end going back to E para mas fulfilling and sulit ung trip down. Guys try niyo. Instead of Dsus2, try a simple Am chord after A. It sounds at least 67.3% better than using Dsus2, without necessarily making the song a bit darker. If any Twice fans here can play the guitar or piano, let me know what you think hehe E Emaj7 Naega ireokedo igijeogieotdeonga E7 E6 A Mwonga ireoke gatgo sipdeon jeok isseonna, isseonna Am E Da nolla, da nolla, nae ppeonppeonhame E C D (Come on and tell me yes) P.S.

       "5  gusto ko lang sana sagutin yung taong to kung sino ka man 1. Para sa akin kasi requirement pa rin dapat ang Filipino. Ito ay dahil kahit na paulit-ulit na nating pinag-aaralan yan, kailangan pa rin nating isanay ang ating mga sarili sa paggamit nito nang tama na tipong magsisilbi siyang paraan para mas maintindihan ka ng mga ibang tao lalo na sa mga taong wala namang background sa English. 2. Para sa akin kasi kailangan mo ipractice nang ipractice ang See Translation Filipino kasi kung matagal mo na siyang hindi nagagamit sa tingin mo ba yung galing mo sa pagsalita ng Filipino noon parehas pa rin ba siya pagkatapos ng matagal na panahon ng hindi mo paggamit nito? Parang math lang yan, hindi porket napag-aralan mo na siya noon, maalala mo na agad kung paano mo isolve ang isang problem after ng ilang yrs na hindi mo paggamit nito. [Meron din akong kakilala na ilang years nasa ibang bansa pero hindi rin siya buong buhay niya doon, dahil nasa ibang bansa siya mas kinailangan niyang gamitin ang English kaysa sa Filipino. Siya na rin mismo nagsabi na nakalimutan na rin niya paano yung mga balarila sa Filipino. (May ganun talagang case believe it or not meng)] 3. Para kanino ba tayo? (Medyo pareho lang punto ko dito at sa 1) Hindi ba ito nakakalungkot? Para sa akin, kaya natin ito ginagawa kasi para makapagsilbi tayo sa mga taong wala namang oportunidad. Hindi ba kaya may wika kasi para mas magkaroon ng maayos na komunikasyon sa mga tao? Kung hindi naman mapapalalim ang kaalaman natin tungkol sa wika natin, paano tayo magiging matagumpay sa pagtulong ng mga taong nasa mga laylayan? Alam mo ba na may mga batas nga na para sa mga kasambahay, magsasaka, atbp. pero halos lahat naman ng mga taong kabilang sa dito, wala naman gaanong alam tungkol dito kasi naka-English yung batas natin. Hindi pa nila maintindihan. Yung layunin na makapagpaalam sa mga taong makikinabang sana sa mga ito, wala na agad dahil doon. So ayun, hindi ko alam kung napakita ko ba yung kahalagahan ng pag-aral nito kahit sa kolehiyo haha sana makuha kahit konti lang hindi ako magaling makipagdebate tungkol sa isyu na ito nakakatrigger ka lang (sinubukan ko rin maging purong Filipino yung sasabihin ko dito, pero kita mo naman di ba haha sana marealize mo yun hehe peace!)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "6  Why do people get mad at the fact that basketball is the most popular sport in the country? They mention how we should just focus on sports like billiards and football or some other height appropriate game. They say that basketball programs should be defunded and that we should literally just play for the medals. Heres the reality. You arent going to convince any young basketball player to play football by defunding basketball programs. These people pl ay basketball because its an entertaining and intense sport that they enjoy playing, of course they want to win but do you really think that forcing young players to play football instead is going to produce the next Messi? No. People play basketball because its what they want, its what entertains them. Watching LeBron drop 51, or Shaq destroying the rim after dunking hard, do you really think you can convince a young kid mesmerized by these videos to stop playing basketball and play tennis, a sport he does not even love? These kids arent playing for the gold medals, they play because they want it. This country wont produce the next Jordan any time soon, or the next Wade, hell it wouldnt even produce just an Isaiah Thomas tier player, but Id rather be in country that encourages people to enjoy what they want and play what they want rather than forcing kids to play a sport they dont give a shit about, just for some medals that other Filipinos brag about. Promote football more, promote tennis more, promote all these lesser popular sports in our country, but remember that bringing down basketball wont turn us into a FIFA competitor to Brazil, you cant convince a person who loves Kyrie Irvings insane ball handling skills to love football just because his countrymen want him to earn a gold medal. A gold medal which he doesnt give a shit about, a medal only there so that Filipinos can brag about being Filipinos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "7  The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 Z-tune is regarded as one of NISMOs finest creations to date! As a tribute to the rich history of the Skyline GT-R (which ended in 2002), NISMO purchased 18 used R34 GT-R V-specs, all of which were to be reworked by the company into one of its most impressive creations to date. NISMO extensively rebuilt the cars stock RB26 engine, by replacing virtually all of the engines original components with variants used by NISMO for their race cars. Special race-car engine treatment like balancing and boring and stroking were done to the RB, increasing its displacement to 2.8L. Even the turbos werent spared, as the ones used by the normal V-spec were replaced with IHI turbos that were set to 1.5 boost. With the engine being complimented by the replaced intercooler and exhaust system, the Z-tune is capable of producing 510hp! The rest of the car was also given a meticulous makeover by NISMO. The cars ability to handle the horses without slip was improved by the utilization of both a twin-plate clutch and an LSD. Parts that were located towards the front of the car such as the front bumper, strut bar, and hood were replaced with carbon fiber variants so as to reduce the weight of the front half of the car. A lot of these CF parts were even spot welded by NISMO to improve the rigidity of the chassis! To lessen body-roll and improve handling, NISMO also replaced the stock V-spec springs with stiffer adjustable ones and adjusted them, giving the car a stiffer suspension, not too good for the streets, but perfect for the track. Special Brembo brakes ensured that the Z-tune had better braking performance, while downforce was improved by the addition of a front splitter and a change of rear spoiler, increasing both front and rear downforce respectively. All of these improvements are not all for show though: The Z-tune was able to set an insane Tsukuba lap time of 1:01, making it the 4th fastest road-legal production car on the track! Nissan originally planned to create 19 examples of this beast, but they ended up producing only 18 Ztunes. This low number of production,combined with this car being a good showcase of NISMOs tuning capabilities, drives the prices of the R34 Z-tune extremely high. From its original selling price of only 17 million yen when new (around $100k), the current selling price of these cars are now in excess of $500k (this particular example selling for $510k!) Sadly, this very high value makes it a collectors item today, which is why youre more likely to find the car now in some rich guys climate-controlled garage instead of the tracks where this beast truly belongs.
